6,acm,A Scalable Methodology to Guide Student Teams Executing Computing Projects,"This article reports on a sequential mixed-methods research study, which compared different approaches on how to guide students through a semester-long data science project. Four different methodologies, ranging from a traditional “just assign some intermediate milestones” to other more Agile methodologies, were first compared via a controlled experiment. The results of this initial experiment showed that the project methodology used made a significant difference in student outcomes. Surprisingly, the Agile Kanban approach was found to be much more effective than the Agile Scrum methodology. Based on these initial results, in the second semester, we focused on use of the Kanban methodology. The findings in the second, more qualitative phase, confirmed the methodology's usefulness and scalability. A key issue when using the scrum methodology was that the students had a very difficult time estimating what could be completed in each of their two-week sprints. The Kanban board, which visually shows and limits work-in-progress, was found to be an effective way for students to communicate with each other as well as with their instructor. In addition, Agile Kanban also streamlined the work required for instructors to efficiently provide guidance to student teams and to understand each team's status. In summary, a scalable Kanban methodology, which can be applied to a wide variety of student computing projects, was found to an effective methodology to guide and manage student projects, improving student outcomes and minimizing instructor workload.","project methodologies, Project-based learning, scalable methodologies","Saltz JS,Heckman RR",,2018,ACM Trans.

To help address this gap, this paper reports on a mixed method qualitative study exploring how a big data science team within a Fortune 500 organization used two different agile process methodologies. The study helps clarify the concept of agility within a big data science project, as well as the key process challenges teams encounter when executing a big data science project. Specifically, three key issues were identified: (a) the challenge in task duration estimation, (b) how to account for team members that might be pulled onto other tasks for short bursts and (c) coordination challenges across the different groups within the big data science team. Our findings help explain how different process methodologies might mitigate or exacerbate these challenges and supports previous research showing that big data science teams would benefit from an increased focus on their process methodology and that adopting an Agile Kanban methodology, which focuses on minimizing work-in-progress, could prove beneficial for many big data science teams.",Big Data Science;Agile;Process Methodology,J.

The paper also reports on a pilot study of teams using the framework. The framework adheres to the lean Kanban philosophy but augments Kanban by providing a structured iteration process for teams to incrementally explore and learn via lean hypothesis testing. Specifically, the Structured Kanban Iteration (SKI) framework focuses on having teams define capability-based iterations (as opposed to Kanban-like no iterations or Scrumlike time-based sprints). Furthermore, unlike Kanban, the framework leverages Scrum best practices to define roles, meetings and artifacts. Thus, SKI implements the Kanban process, but with a more repeatable and structured approach.",Data Science;Big Data;Agile;Process Methodology,J. Saltz; A.

20,ieeex,Applying Scrum in Data Science Projects,"The rise of big data has led to an increase in data science projects conducted by organizations. Such projects aim to create valuable insights by improving decision making or enhancing an organization's service offering through data-driven services. However, the majority of data science projects still fail to deliver the expected value. To increase the success rate of projects, the use of process models or methodologies is recommended in the literature. Nevertheless, organizations are hardly using them because they are considered too rigid and they do not support the typical iterative and open nature of data science projects. To overcome this problem, this research suggests applying Agile methodologies to data science projects. Agile methodologies were originally developed in the software engineering domain and are characterised by their iterative approach towards software development. In this study, we selected the Scrum approach and integrated it into the CRISP-DM methodology for data science projects using a Design Science Research approach. This new methodology was then evaluated in three different case organizations using expert interviews. Analysis of the expert interviews resulted in a further refinement of the Agile data science methodology proposed by this research.",Data Science;Agile;Scrum,J. Baijens; R. Helms; D.

While the use of Kanban is growing, little has been done to explore how to improve team performance for teams that use Kanban. One possibility is to introduce a Kanban Coach (KC). This work reports on exploring the use of a Kanban Coach, with respect to both how the coach could interact with the team as well as how the use of a coach impacts team results. Specifically, this paper reports on an experiment where teams either had, or did not have, a Kanban Coach. A quantitative and qualitative analysis of the data collected during the experiment found that introducing KC led to significant improvement of team performance. Coordination Theory and Shared Mental Models were then employed to provide an explanation as to why a KC leads to better project results.

219,scopus,Exploring the challenges of integrating data science roles in agile autonomous teams,"The notion of autonomous teams is core to agile software development. However, autonomy in agile teams is challenged by increasingly complex software projects, large-scale agile and perhaps increasingly multidisciplinary teams. At the same time, data science roles are making their way into agile teams as companies seek to reap the potential advantages of using data to develop better and more competitive services and products. The consequences of implementing such roles in traditional agile teams are largely unknown. In this paper, we take an exploratory approach to the topic of data science roles in agile teams by a set of interviews with five data scientists as well as three members of an agile software development team. Based on the interviews we identify a set of challenges associated with incorporating the role in agile autonomous teams. Based on these challenges we discuss preliminary recommendations for companies seeking to integrate data science roles in agile teams. © The Author(s) 2019.",Agile; Autonomy; Data science; Software development; Teams,"Hukkelberg I., Berntzen M.","Department of Informatics, University of Oslo, Gaustadalléen 23B, Oslo, 0730, Norway",2019,Lecture Notes in Business Information Processing,Springer Verlag,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85072843077&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-30126-2_5&partnerID=40&md5=58b9cef0fe1330087bed95a07ae893b1,10.1007/978-3-030-30126-2_5,20230520-160000,20230521-235245,0,20230521-235258,0,,20230528-130000,0,,20230603-213000,Not excluded,Not excluded,N/A,I.

242,scopus,Development of human faces retrieval in a big photo database with SCRUM: A case study,"In this paper we present a case study of the use of SCRUM in an applied research scenario, consisting of the detection and identification of human faces in a large database of photos. The study shows how the adoption of agile methods was important to deal with uncertainty and unstable requirements, allowing adaptable development with opportunity to learn from the development process. The implementation of experiments reveals, as our research advances, the applicability of techniques to support the solution for the requirements. All sort of problems with illumination, pose, low quality of image and other type of noise were present as obstacles to accuracy in different approaches for detection and recognition. Fast retrieval of similar faces was also necessary. In the end, the requirements were successfully tackled by developing an efficient and short implementation of face alignment, feature extraction and search. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.",Agile methodology; Big data; Face detection; Face recognition; SCRUM,"Pivetta T.A., Forster C.H.Q., Dias L.A.V., Guerra E.M.","Instituto Tecnologico de Aeronautica, ITA, Sao Jose dos Campos, Sao Paulo, Brazil; Instituto Nacional de Pesquisa Espacial, INPE, Sao Jose dos Campos, Sao Paulo, Brazil",2018,Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing,Springer Verlag,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85048501559&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-319-54978-1_122&partnerID=40&md5=f85fed6ecf0688c671a227619e9f3b6d,10.1007/978-3-319-54978-1_122,20230520-160000,20230521-235245,0,20230521-235258,0,,20230528-130000,0,,20230603-213000,Not excluded,Not excluded,N/A,T.

276,scopus,Agile clinical research: A data science approach to scrumban in clinical medicine,"The COVID-19 pandemic has required greater minute-to-minute urgency of patient treatment in Intensive Care Units (ICUs), rendering the use of Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) too slow to be effective for treatment discovery. There is a need for agility in clinical research, and the use of data science to develop predictive models for patient treatment is a potential solution. However, rapidly developing predictive models in healthcare is challenging given the complexity of healthcare problems and the lack of regular interaction between data scientists and physicians. Data scientists can spend significant time working in isolation to build predictive models that may not be useful in clinical environments. We propose the use of an agile data science framework based on the Scrumban framework used in software development. Scrumban is an iterative framework, where in each iteration larger problems are broken down into simple do-able tasks for data scientists and physicians. The two sides collaborate closely in formulating clinical questions and developing and deploying predictive models into clinical settings. Physicians can provide feedback or new hypotheses given the performance of the model, and refinement of the model or clinical questions can take place in the next iteration. The rapid development of predictive models can now be achieved with increasing numbers of publicly available healthcare datasets and easily accessible cloud-based data science tools. What is truly needed are data scientist and physician partnerships ensuring close collaboration between the two sides in using these tools to develop clinically useful predictive models to meet the demands of the COVID-19 healthcare landscape. © 2020 The Authors",Agile; Amazon Web Services; Cloud Computing; Minimal Viable Model; Predictive model; Scrumban,"Lei H., O'Connell R., Ehwerhemuepha L., Taraman S., Feaster W., Chang A.","CHOC Children's Hospital, Orange, CA, United States; The Sharon Disney Lund Medical Intelligence and Innovation Institute (MI3), United States; University of California-Irvine, Department of Pathology, United States; Chapman University School of Computational and Data Science, Orange, CA, United States; Department of Pediatrics, University of California-Irvine, School of Medicine, United States",2020,Intelligence-Based Medicine,Elsevier B.V.,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85112231323&doi=10.1016%2fj.ibmed.2020.100009&partnerID=40&md5=ac5ff500db38dd67e822cabcdc54db93,10.1016/j.ibmed.2020.100009,20230520-160000,20230521-235245,0,20230521-235258,0,,20230528-130000,0,,20230603-213000,Not excluded,Not excluded,N/A,H.

577,wos,Agile supply chain analytic approach: a case study combining agile and CRISP-DM in an end-to-end supply chain,"In the current competitive environment, Big Data Analytics (BDA) has become a prominent metric to reach an integrated, efficient, and effective supply chain (SC). In the literature, the BDA capabilities have been at the forefront of research in operational supply chain management (SCM), however, there has been a paucity of literature regarding its technical and organisational implementation in the industry. Hence, despite its capabilities and importance, many organisations are reluctant to adopt this promising concept in SC operations management, due to the ambiguity of its practical implementation from a technical and organisational point of view. To address this gap, this paper draws on agile project management, data mining model processing, and case study approaches to propose and test a framework for BDA organisational implementation in SCM. The feasibility of the proposed framework is illustrated and tested by a case study in an end-to-end SC within a large corporation. Our contribution lies in handling the organisational, managerial, and socio-technical challenges of BDA projects implementation in SCM.",Supply chain management; Big Data Analytics; agile methodology; CRISP-DM methodology; Scrum; project management,"Hamdani, FE; Quintero, IAQ; Enjolras, M; Camargo, M; Monticolo, D; Lelong, C",Universite de Lorraine,,SUPPLY CHAIN FORUM,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,,10.1080/16258312.2022.2064721,20230520-160000,20230521-235245,0,20230521-235258,0,,20230529-233000,0,,20230604-020000,Not excluded,Not excluded,N/A,F.
