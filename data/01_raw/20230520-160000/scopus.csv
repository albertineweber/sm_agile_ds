To help address this gap, this paper reports on a mixed method qualitative study exploring how a big data science team within a Fortune 500 organization used two different agile process methodologies. The study helps clarify the concept of agility within a big data science project, as well as the key process challenges teams encounter when executing a big data science project. Specifically, three key issues were identified: (a) the challenge in task duration estimation, (b) how to account for team members that might be pulled onto other tasks for short bursts and (c) coordination challenges across the different groups within the big data science team. Our findings help explain how different process methodologies might mitigate or exacerbate these challenges and supports previous research showing that big data science teams would benefit from an increased focus on their process methodology and that adopting an Agile Kanban methodology, which focuses on minimizing work-in-progress, could prove beneficial for many big data science teams. © 2019 IEEE.","Agile; Big Data Science; Process Methodology","Data Science; Human resource management; Agile; Agile process; Key process; Mixed method; Qualitative study; Short bursts; Team members; Work in progress; Big data",,"Baru C.Huan J.Khan L.Hu X.T.Ak R.Tian Y.Barga R.Zaniolo C.Lee K.Ye Y.F.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781728108582,,,"English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

The framework adheres to the lean Kanban philosophy but augments Kanban by providing a structured iteration process for teams to incrementally explore and learn via lean hypothesis testing. Specifically, the Structured Kanban Iteration (SKI) framework focuses on having teams define capability-based iterations (as opposed to Kanban-like no iterations or Scrumlike time-based sprints). Furthermore, unlike Kanban, the framework leverages Scrum best practices to define roles, meetings and artifacts. Thus, SKI implements the Kanban process, but with a more repeatable and structured approach. © 2019 IEEE.","Agile; Big Data; Data Science; Process Methodology","Big data; Data Science; Iterative methods; Project management; Agile; Best practices; Hypothesis testing; Iteration process; Pilot studies; Process framework; Process management; Structured approach; Human resource management",,"Baru C.Huan J.Khan L.Hu X.T.Ak R.Tian Y.Barga R.Zaniolo C.Lee K.Ye Y.F.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781728108582,,,"English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

However, many of these projects fail to deliver the expected value. It has been observed that a key reason many data science projects don’t succeed is not technical in nature, but rather, the process aspect of the project. The lack of established and mature methodologies for executing data science projects has been frequently noted as a reason for these project failures. To help move the field forward, this study presents a systematic review of research focused on the adoption of big data science process frameworks. The goal of the review was to identify (1) the key themes, with respect to current research on how teams execute data science projects, (2) the most common approaches regarding how data science projects are organized, managed and coordinated, (3) the activities involved in a data science projects life cycle, and (4) the implications for future research in this field. In short, the review identified 68 primary studies thematically classified in six categories. Two of the themes (workflow and agility) accounted for approximately 80% of the identified studies. The findings regarding workflow approaches consist mainly of adaptations to CRISP-DM (vs entirely new proposed methodologies). With respect to agile approaches, most of the studies only explored the conceptual benefits of using an agile approach in a data science project (vs actually evaluating an agile framework being used in a data science context). Hence, one finding from this research is that future research should explore how to best achieve the theorized benefits of agility. Another finding is the need to explore how to efficiently combine workflow and agile frameworks within a data science context to achieve a more comprehensive approach for project execution © 2022 Saltz and Krasteva","Agile data science; Big data science; Big data science workflows; Process frameworks; Project execution","Data Science; Decision making; Life cycle; 'current; Agile approaches; Agile data science; Big data science; Big data science workflow; Process framework; Project execution; Science projects; Systematic literature review; Work-flows; Big data","Krasteva, I.; GATE Institute, Bulgaria; email: iva.krasteva@gate-ai.eu",,"PeerJ Inc.",23765992,,,,"English","PeerJ Comput.

Such projects aim to create valuable insights by improving decision making or enhancing an organization's service offering through data-driven services. However, the majority of data science projects still fail to deliver the expected value. To increase the success rate of projects, the use of process models or methodologies is recommended in the literature. Nevertheless, organizations are hardly using them because they are considered too rigid and they do not support the typical iterative and open nature of data science projects. To overcome this problem, this research suggests applying Agile methodologies to data science projects. Agile methodologies were originally developed in the software engineering domain and are characterised by their iterative approach towards software development. In this study, we selected the Scrum approach and integrated it into the CRISP-DM methodology for data science projects using a Design Science Research approach. This new methodology was then evaluated in three different case organizations using expert interviews. Analysis of the expert interviews resulted in a further refinement of the Agile data science methodology proposed by this research. © 2020 IEEE.","Agile; Data Science; Scrum","Decision making; Iterative methods; Software design; Agile Methodologies; Design-science researches; Expected values; Iterative approach; Science methodologies; Science projects; Service offering; Software engineering domain; Data Science",,"Aier S.Gordijn J.Proper H.A.Verelst J.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781728199269,,,"English","Proc. - IEEE Conf.

This data evolution can be captured using ubiquitous integrated sensors and multiple smart machines. We believe the use of data science methodologies, for the selection of models and configuration of hyper-parameters, may help to better control such data evolution. But, at the same time, the industrial practitioners and researchers often lack machine-learning expertise to directly retrieve the benefit from valuable manufacturing big data. Such a lack poses the major obstacle to yield value from even-though familiar data. In this case, a collaboration with data scientists may become an exigence along with the extensive machine learning knowledge which presumably may result to pursue further delays and effort. Multiple approaches for automating machine learning (AutoML) have been proposed for the past recent years in order to alleviate this deficiency. These approaches are expected to perform better along with accomplishment of computing resources which are mostly not readily accessible. To address this research challenge, in this paper, we propose a meta-learning based approach that may serve an effective decision support system for the AutoML process.

However, many industries cannot effectively incorporate data science into their business processes, as there is no comprehensive approach that allows strategic planning for organization-wide data science efforts and data assets. Accordingly, this study explores the Data Science Roadmapping (DSR) to guide organizations in aligning their business strategies with data-related, technological, and organizational resources. The proposed approach is built on the widely adopted technology roadmapping framework and customizes its context, architecture, and process by synthesizing data science, big data, and data-driven organization literature. Based on industry collaborations, the framework provides a hybrid and agile methodology comprising the recommended steps. We applied DSR with a research group with sector experience to create a comprehensive data science roadmap to validate and refine the framework. The results indicate that the framework facilitates DSR initiatives by creating a comprehensive roadmap capturing strategy, data, technology, and organizational perspectives. The contemporary literature illustrates prebuilt roadmaps to help businesses become data-driven. However, becoming data-driven also necessitates significant social change toward openness and trust. The DSR initiative can facilitate this social change by opening communication channels, aligning perspectives, and generating consensus among stakeholders. © 2021","Big data; Data science; Data-driven organization; Digital transformation; Technology management; Technology roadmapping","Big data; Competition; Metadata; Architectural frameworks; Competitive advantage; Data driven; Data-driven organization; Digital transformation; Roadmap; Roadmapping; Social changes; Technology managements; Technology roadmapping; Data Science; architecture; conceptual framework; data set; stakeholder; technological development","Kayabay, K.; Middle East Technical University, Turkey; email: kerem.kayabay@metu.edu.tr",,"Elsevier Inc.",00401625,,,,"English","Technol.

During this time, the practices of running such projects, together with the tools used to run them, have evolved considerably. Furthermore, there are various studies on data science workflows and data science project teams. However, studies looking into both workflows and teams are still scarce and comprehensive works to build a holistic view do not exist. This study bases on a prior case study on roles and processes in data science. The goal here is to create a deeper understanding of data science projects and development processes. We conducted a survey targeted at experts working in the field of data science (n=50) to understand data science projects' team structure, roles in the teams, utilized project management practices and the challenges in data science work. Results show little difference between big data projects and other data science. The found differences, however, give pointers for future research on how agile data science projects are, and how important is the role of supporting project management personnel. The current study is work in progress and attempts to spark discussion and new research directions. © 2021 IEEE.","agile practices; Data science; project management; teamwork","Data Science; Human resource management; Information management; Agile practices; Case-studies; Empirical studies; Holistic view; Project process; Project team; Science development; Science projects; Teamwork; Work-flows; Project management",,"Chen Y.Ludwig H.Tu Y.Fayyad U.Zhu X.Hu X.T.Byna S.Liu X.Zhang J.Pan S.Papalexakis V.Wang J.Cuzzocrea A.Ordonez C.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781665439022,,,"English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

However, there are very few studies using real data on how effective such planning is or guidelines on how to plan such projects. In this paper, we analyze data taken from several software projects using Scrum tools. We compare the data for data science/ML and non-ML projects, in an attempt to understand if data science and ML projects are planned or executed any differently compared to normal software engineering projects. We also perform a story classification task using machine learning to analyze story logs for agile tasks for several teams. We find there are differences in what makes a good ML story as opposed to a non ML story. After analyzing this data, we propose a few ways in which software projects, whether machine learning related or not, can be better logged and executed using Scrum tools like Jira. © 2020 IEEE.","agile methodology; machine learning project; scrum; software engineering","Data Science; Industry 4.0; Software engineering; Agile Methodologies; Software engineering projects; Software project; Story classification; Machine learning","Vinayak, T.M.; Samsung Rd InstituteIndia; email: vinayak.m@samsung.com",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781728149943,,,"English","Proc.

With big data analysis, solutions have become more accurate. However, due to a lack of experience with big data, projects that generally handle big data have a higher failure rate in terms of time, money and user satisfaction. Therefore, projects involving big data should differ from a typical project. Using the case of the Seoul Metropolitan City Owl Bus, the authors have setup project procedures and raised several issues developers would do well to consider when dealing with big data. When the Seoul City Government in South Korea planned the night bus lines and its schedules, it made use of big data to do so.

This study employs a quantitative bibliometric method–specifically, a keyword co-occurrence network analysis–on a set of papers extracted from Scopus. The results obtained allowed the researchers to identify a set of DS techniques and tools that can support LP practices and to develop a model to guide their implementation based on the typical improvement implementation stages of the plan-do-check-act cycle.

Four different methodologies, ranging from a traditional “just assign some intermediate milestones” to other more Agile methodologies, were first compared via a controlled experiment. The results of this initial experiment showed that the project methodology used made a significant difference in student outcomes. Surprisingly, the Agile Kanban approach was found to be much more effective than the Agile Scrum methodology. Based on these initial results, in the second semester, we focused on use of the Kanban methodology. The findings in the second, more qualitative phase, confirmed the methodology’s usefulness and scalability. A key issue when using the scrum methodology was that the students had a very difficult time estimating what could be completed in each of their two-week sprints. The Kanban board, which visually shows and limits work-in-progress, was found to be an effective way for students to communicate with each other as well as with their instructor. In addition, Agile Kanban also streamlined the work required for instructors to efficiently provide guidance to student teams and to understand each team’s status. In summary, a scalable Kanban methodology, which can be applied to a wide variety of student computing projects, was found to an effective methodology to guide and manage student projects, improving student outcomes and minimizing instructor workload. © 2018 ACM.","Project methodologies; Project-based learning; Scalable methodologies","Scalability; Agile Methodologies; Computing projects; Controlled experiment; Mixed-methods research; Project based learning; Project methodologies; Scalable methodologies; Scrum methodologies; Students",,,"Association for Computing Machinery",19466226,,,,"English","ACM J.

Specifically, data from 80 teams was used to build and test machine learning models that predict teams at risk for delivering low quality results.

However, despite its importance, requirement engineering has several limitations such as incomplete requirements, vague requirements, lack of prioritization, and less user involvement, all of which affect requirement quality. With the emergence of big data technology, the complexity of big data, which is defined by large data volume, high velocity, and large data variety, has gradually increased, affecting the quality of big data software requirements. This study proposes a framework with four sequential phases to improve requirement engineering quality through big data software development. By integrating the proposed framework’s phases in which user requirements are collected in a complete vision using traditional requirement elicitation techniques with agile methodology and mind mapping, the collected requirements are displayed via a graphical representation using mind maps to achieve high requirement accuracy with connectivity and modifiability, enabling the accurate prioritization of requirements implemented using agile SCRUM methodology. The proposed framework improves requirement quality in big data software development, which is represented by accuracy, completeness, connectivity, and modifiability to understand the value of the collected requirements and effectively affect the quality of the implementation phase. © 2021.

The needs come about due to organizations that crave predictive analytics capabilities to reduce risk, make intelligent decisions, and generate different customer experiences. Similarly, visual analytics play an essential role in understanding and fitting the analytics prediction in their business decision. Hence, the combination of descriptive, diagnostics and predictive within Visual Analytics emerges as a balanced field to provide understandable predictive insight. Due to the organizational demand and multi-discipline area, the approach to developing visual analytics is still uncertain in the Big Data Project Lifecycle from methodological perspectives. While there are a few potential methodological approaches that could be used for visual analytics, they are scattered across numerous academic research and industrial practice. To date, there is no coherent review and analysis of the work that has been explored specifically for Visual Analytics methodology. This paper reports on a review of previous literature concerning how Visual Analytics has been executed in the big data life cycle to address the gap. The review is organized in this study from three perspectives: i) general ICT -related methodology (e.g. SDLC, Agile, DevOps), ii) Data Science-related methodology (e.g. CRISP-DM, SEMMA, KDD) and iii) Visual Analytics-related methodologies in which each method will be benchmarked based on the Visual Analytics major part of reality, computer and human, in terms of its width, Depth, and flows. This study found insufficiencies, non-specific and vague conditions in handling the Visual Analytics when using current methodological approaches based on the review conducted. The paper also highlights the Visual Analytics-related methodological review, which can shed some light on the approaches and ways of implementing analytics in the big data lifecycle, which can be beneficial for future studies in proposing a more comprehensive methodology for Visual Analytics in the big data lifecycle. © 2022 IEEE.","big data analytics; methodology; process; visual analytics","Data Analytics; Industrial research; Life cycle; Predictive analytics; Big data analytic; Customer experience; Data analytics; Data lifecycle; Data usage; Intelligent decisions; Methodological approach; Methodology; Process; Visual analytics; Big data",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781665468350,,,"English","HORA - Int.

While the use of Kanban is growing, little has been done to explore how to improve team performance for teams that use Kanban. One possibility is to introduce a Kanban Coach (KC). This work reports on exploring the use of a Kanban Coach, with respect to both how the coach could interact with the team as well as how the use of a coach impacts team results. Specifically, this paper reports on an experiment where teams either had, or did not have, a Kanban Coach. A quantitative and qualitative analysis of the data collected during the experiment found that introducing KC led to significant improvement of team performance. Coordination Theory and Shared Mental Models were then employed to provide an explanation as to why a KC leads to better project results. While this experiment was done within a data science project context, the results are likely applicable across a range of information system projects. © 2019, SciKA.","Agile; Kanban; Kanban process methodology; Process methodology; Project management; Team performance",,,,"SciKA",21827796,,,,"English","Int.

Nevertheless, agile methodologies focus on contact with contracting customers and generating value for them. Usually, the communication between end users (they use the software and have low decision power) and the agile team is mediated by customers (they have high decision power but do not use the software). However, they do not know the actual problems that end users (may) face in their routine, and they may not be directly affected by software shortcomings. In this context, UX issues are typically identified only after the implementation, during user testing and validation. Objective: Aiming to improve the understanding and definition of the problem in agile projects, this research investigates the practices and difficulties experienced by agile teams during the development of data science and process automation projects. Also, we analyze the benefits and the teams’ perceptions regarding user participation in these projects. Method: We collected data from four agile teams, in the context of an academia and industry collaboration focusing on delivering data science and process automation solutions. Therefore, we applied a carefully designed questionnaire answered by developers, scrum masters, and UX designers. In total, 18 subjects answered the questionnaire. Results: From the results, we identify practices used by the teams to define and understand the problem and to represent the solution. The practices most often used are prototypes and meetings with stakeholders. Another practice that helped the team to understand the problem was using Lean Inception (LI) ideation workshops. Also, our results present some specific issues regarding data science projects. Conclusion: We observed that end-user participation can be critical to understanding and defining the problem. They help to define elements of the domain and barriers in the implementation. We identified a need for approaches that facilitate user-team communication in data science projects to understand the data and its value to the users’ routine. We also identified insights about the need of more detailed requirements representations to support the development of data science solutions. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Agile; Data science; Lean inception; User experience; User involvement; User participation; User-centered design","Automation; Data Science; Process control; Agile; Agile Methodologies; Agile teams; Decision power; End-users; Lean inception; Process automation; User involvement; User participation; Users' experiences; User centered design","Ferreira, B.; Departament of Informatics, Rua Marques de Sao Vicente, 225/410, RDC, Gavea, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; email: bruna@exacta.inf.puc-rio.br",,"Elsevier B.V.",09505849,,ISOTE,,"English","Inf Software Technol",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85145568139

However, autonomy in agile teams is challenged by increasingly complex software projects, large-scale agile and perhaps increasingly multidisciplinary teams. At the same time, data science roles are making their way into agile teams as companies seek to reap the potential advantages of using data to develop better and more competitive services and products. The consequences of implementing such roles in traditional agile teams are largely unknown. In this paper, we take an exploratory approach to the topic of data science roles in agile teams by a set of interviews with five data scientists as well as three members of an agile software development team. Based on the interviews we identify a set of challenges associated with incorporating the role in agile autonomous teams.

We are therefore moving towards an era of big data, with the added challenges that, in this area, data sources are highly heterogeneous, at a variety of scales, and include a mix of structured and unstructured data. The key requirement is therefore one of integration and subsequent analyses of this complex web of data. This paper examines the potential of a data-driven approach to support decision-making in flood risk management, with the goal of investigating a suitable software architecture and associated set of techniques to support a more data-centric approach. The key contribution of the paper is a cloud-based data hypercube that achieves the desired level of integration of highly complex data. This hypercube builds on innovations in cloud services for data storage, semantic enrichment and querying, and also features the use of notebook technologies to support open and collaborative scenario analyses in support of decision making. The paper also highlights the success of our agile methodology in weaving together cross-disciplinary perspectives and in engaging a wide range of stakeholders in exploring possible technological futures for flood risk management. © 2020 The Authors.

The problem of choosing Agile techniques is complicated by the fact that each of the known frameworks has its own advantages and disadvantages. Depending on the type of project, a particular tool can influence various criteria for the success of the project. In addition, research has shown that some enterprises use separate elements of a particular framework. Therefore, the scientific novelty of the article lies in the study of the influence of individual elements of Agile techniques on the success of the project and its course. With the help of expert assessment in the work, a quantity of separate elements of Agile were formed. These techniques are the most common among practicing managers of Big Data project.

Literature has discussed the benefits and challenges related to the deployment of big data within operations and supply chains, but there has not been a study of the facilitating roles of BDBA in achieving an enhanced level of agile manufacturing practices. As a response to this gap, and drawing upon multiple qualitative case studies undertaken among four UK organisations, we present and validate a framework for the role of BDBA within agile manufacturing. The findings show that market turbulence has negative universal effects and that agile manufacturing enablers are being progressively deployed and aided by BDBA to yield better competitive and business performance objectives. Further, the level of intervention was found to differ across companies depending on the extent of deployment of BDBA, which accounts for variations in outcomes. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","agile manufacturing; big data and business analytics; competitive advantage; enablers; performance","Competition; Manufacture; Supply chains; Agile manufacturing; Business analytics; Competitive advantage; enablers; performance; Big data","Gunasekaran, A.; School of Business and Public Administration, United States; email: agunasekaran@csub.edu",,"Taylor and Francis Ltd.",00207543,,IJPRB,,"English","Int J Prod Res",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032702646

The paper then explores what key actions data science teams using CRISP-DM should consider that addresses CRISP-DM's weaknesses. In brief, CRISP-DM, which is the most popular framework teams use to execute data science projects, provides an easy to understand description of the data science project workflow (i.e., the data science life cycle). However, CRISP-DM's project phases miss some key aspects of the data science project life cycle. In addition, CRISP-DM's task-focused approach fails to address how a team should prioritize tasks, and in general, collaborate and communicate. Hence, this paper also describes how CRISP-DM could be combined with a team coordination framework, such as Scrum or Data Driven Scrum, which is a newer collaboration framework developed to address the unique data science coordination challenges. © 2021 IEEE.",,"Data Science; Life cycle; Collaboration framework; Coordination frameworks; CRISP-DM; Data driven; Key actions; Project phasis; Project's life cycle; Science projects; Team coordination; Work-flows; Human resource management","Saltz, J.S.; Syracuse UniversityUnited States; email: jsaltz@syr.edu","Chen Y.Ludwig H.Tu Y.Fayyad U.Zhu X.Hu X.T.Byna S.Liu X.Zhang J.Pan S.Papalexakis V.Wang J.Cuzzocrea A.Ordonez C.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781665439022,,,"English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

While these methods are necessary, they are insufficient to achieve the full personalized medicine promise. A rigorous, complementary 'small data' paradigm that can function both autonomously from and in collaboration with big data is also needed. By 'small data' we build on Estrin's formulation and refer to the rigorous use of data by and for a specific N-of-1 unit (i.e., a single person, clinic, hospital, healthcare system, community, city, etc.) to facilitate improved individual-level description, prediction and, ultimately, control for that specific unit. Main body: The purpose of this piece is to articulate why a small data paradigm is needed and is valuable in itself, and to provide initial directions for future work that can advance study designs and data analytic techniques for a small data approach to precision health. Scientifically, the central value of a small data approach is that it can uniquely manage complex, dynamic, multi-causal, idiosyncratically manifesting phenomena, such as chronic diseases, in comparison to big data. Beyond this, a small data approach better aligns the goals of science and practice, which can result in more rapid agile learning with less data. There is also, feasibly, a unique pathway towards transportable knowledge from a small data approach, which is complementary to a big data approach. Future work should (1) further refine appropriate methods for a small data approach; (2) advance strategies for better integrating a small data approach into real-world practices; and (3) advance ways of actively integrating the strengths and limitations from both small and big data approaches into a unified scientific knowledge base that is linked via a robust science of causality. Conclusion: Small data is valuable in its own right. That said, small and big data paradigms can and should be combined via a foundational science of causality. With these approaches combined, the vision of precision health can be achieved. © 2019 The Author(s).","Artificial intelligence; Data science; Personalized medicine; Precision health; Precision medicine; Small data","analytic method; Article; causality; chronic disease; clinical practice; data processing; health care system; human; personalized medicine; population health; public health; reference database; study design; cooperation; health care delivery; high throughput screening; information processing; learning; procedures; small-area analysis; statistical analysis; Cooperative Behavior; Data Interpretation, Statistical; Data Science; Datasets as Topic; Delivery of Health Care; High-Throughput Screening Assays; Humans; Learning; Precision Medicine; Small-Area Analysis","Hekler, E.B.; Center for Wireless and Population Health Systems, 9500 Gilman Ave, United States; email: ehekler@eng.ucsd.edu",,"BioMed Central Ltd.",17417015,,,"31311528","English","BMC Med.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069510980

The application of big data analysis technology provides an opportunity for local governments to conduct the COVID-19 epidemic emergency management more scientifically. The present study, based on emergency management lifecycle theory, includes a comprehensive analysis of the application framework of China’s SARS epidemic emergency management lacked the support of big data technology in 2003. In contrast, this study first proposes a more agile and efficient application framework, supported by big data technology, for the COVID-19 epidemic emergency management and then analyses the differences between the two frameworks. Methods: This study takes Hainan Province, China as its case study by using a file content analysis and semistructured interviews to systematically comprehend the strategy and mechanism of Hainan’s application of big data technology in its COVID-19 epidemic emergency management. Results: Hainan Province adopted big data technology during the four stages, i.e., migration, preparedness, response, and recovery, of its COVID-19 epidemic emergency management. Hainan Province developed advanced big data management mechanisms and technologies for practical epidemic emergency management, thereby verifying the feasibility and value of the big data technology application framework we propose. Conclusions: This study provides empirical evidence for certain aspects of the theory, mechanism, and technology for local governments in different countries and regions to apply, in a precise, agile, and evidence-based manner, big data technology in their formulations of comprehensive COVID-19 epidemic emergency management strategies. © 2021, The Author(s).","Application framework; Big data technology; China; COVID-19; Emergency management; Hainan Province; Local government","China; epidemic; epidemiology; government; human; technology; Big Data; China; COVID-19; Epidemics; Humans; Local Government; SARS-CoV-2; Technology","Zou, Q.; Non-traditional Security Institute, China; email: zouqi.hust.18@gmail.com",,"BioMed Central Ltd",14712458,,,"34736445","English","BMC Public Health",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118708006

Big data analytics is now viewed as a disruptive technology that will significantly transform business intelligence and analytics. Therefore, big data technology, as a way to analyze and comprehend turbulent environments, has attracted huge interest from researchers and practitioners. Such environments are highly challenging for enterpris-es; how can they deal with such turbulence and stay competitive? The valuable information that this technology can offer seems almost limitless. Can big data help organizations deal with turbulent environments, and if so, how? We address this question by closely examining the relations between (1) big data analytics capabilities and dynamic capabilities, (2) dynamic capabilities and competitive performance, (3) big data analytics capabilities and operational capabilities, and (4) operational capabilities and competitive performance. Big data analytics capabilities are necessary to use big data effectively. We developed a model with four hypotheses to investigate these relations. We conducted a survey among 107 respondents from the largest companies in the Nordic countries. All but one of our hypotheses were supported. This research contributes to a better understanding of how big data analytic investments support agile capabilities, in turn promoting competitive performance. © Scandinavian Journal of Information Systems,.","big data analytics; big data analytics capabilities; competitive performance; dynamic capabilities; operational capabilities",,,,"IRIS Association",09050167,,,,"English","Scand.

In this paper, we analyze project issues tracking data taken from Scrum (a popular tool for Agile) for several machine learning projects. We compare this data with corresponding data from non-machine learning projects, in an attempt to analyze how machine learning projects are executed differently from normal software engineering projects. On analysis, we find that machine learning project issues use different kinds of words to describe issues, have higher number of exploratory or research oriented tasks as compared to implementation tasks, and have a higher number of issues in the product backlog after each sprint, denoting that it is more difficult to estimate the duration of machine learning project related tasks in advance. After analyzing this data, we propose a few ways in which Agile machine learning projects can be better logged and executed, given their differences with normal software engineering projects. © 2018 IEEE.","agile methodology; machine learning project; scrum; software engineering","Learning systems; Software engineering; Teaching; Agile Methodologies; scrum; Software engineering projects; Tracking data; Machine learning",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781538682357,,,"English","INDICON - IEEE India Council Int.

A possible reason for this may be the narrow focus and lack of interdisciplinary approach to big data analytics education. To address this challenge, this panel brings together practitioners, researchers and educators in big data and analytics; to explore the potentials for developing an interdisciplinary curriculum that will deliver data analytics skills to students across all other academic majors.

Nursing value measurement depends on the availability of essential data attributes in the electronic health record related to nursing care delivered (what happened, when, and the result seen). Key in measuring value is a standardized structure and format of these attributes for enabling uniform consistent analysis, along with data sets that are sharable and comparable across individuals and groups, time, organization, and practice focus. The foundation of such sharable and comparable data sets would represent at a minimum individual essential nurse care actions and the resulting patient outcome(s). While nurses generate an extraordinary amount of health-related data, healthcare information systems are not designed to collect structured data that reflect the unique attributes of nursing care or support nursing analytic activities that would measure value. More important, the multidimensional features of the nursing process are difficult to untangle and differentiate from other healthcare workers and nonnursing care activities. The complexity of nursing knowledge work has limited the development of nursing data science methods like value measurement and discouraged value versus cost discussions. This article sets out to describe nursing value measurement and an approach that nurse scientists are maximizing through methods adapted from agile project management, including user stories, and business analysis processes to recognize nurses as primary contributors to patient outcomes and value generation. Nursing Value User Story methods deconstruct complex nursing scenarios into user stories that capture nursing actions as standardized data that can be mapped to a common nursing data model.

Drawing on the dynamic capabilities theory, we hypothesize that supply chain strategy (i.e., lean and agile supply chain strategy) will positively mediate the relationship between BDA and SC performance. Further, from the perspective of strategy alignment, we also hypothesize that the effect of supply chain strategy on SC performance will be moderated by IS strategy (i.e., IS innovator and IS conservative strategy). Our study uses 159 match-paired questionnaires collected from Chinese firms to empirically test the hypotheses. This paper explains how BDA can improve SC performance and reveals the interaction effect of IS strategy and supply chain strategy on SC performance, which contributes to theoretical and practical implications. © ICIS 2020.

Incident response teams are employed by the enterprises for the identification, management, and elimination of cybersecurity attacks along with for the recovery of business operations timely and effectively. In this paper, we argue that to effectively react to the cybersecurity attacks enterprises should build agility in their incident response method and big data analytics performs an effective role in developing agility in incident response. Grounded on twenty-one in depth expert interviews, we develop a framework that explains the salient features and effect of big data analytics in the incident response method at three stages, i.e., manual analysis, basic analysis, and advanced analysis. The agile properties of flexibility, innovation and swiftness are instilled in the incident response method by practicing big data analytics at higher stages of analysis. The results informed that the key features of big data analytics can be firstly utilize to estimate the existing analytical capability and secondly as an assisting tool to enhance incident response method capability. © 2022 IEEE.","agility; analytical capability; Big data analytics; cybersecurity; incident response","Big data; Crime; Data Analytics; Human resource management; Network security; Agility; Analytical capability; Big data analytic; Business operation; Cyber security; Cyber-attacks; Data analytics; Incident response; Manual analysis; Salient features; Cybersecurity",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781665464772,,,"English","Int.

At that time, almost 30 undergraduate and graduate students from three different courses within just 17 academic weeks had the opportunity of conceptualizing, modeling, and developing a Computer System based on Big Data, Internet of Things, and other emerging technologies for governmental organizations and private sectors. The purpose of this system was to aggregate data and integrate actors, such as Patients, Hospitals, Physicians, and Suppliers for decision making processes related to crises management involving events of health systems, such as epidemics, that needs to manage data and information. Differently from other existing products from Universities, Research Centers, Governmental Agencies, Public and/or Private companies, this product was developed and tested in just 17 academic weeks, applying the Scrum agile method and its best practices available in the market. This experience was stored in a Google site and implemented as a Proof of Concept (PoC). It represents just one example of how to address the old problems of teaching, learning, and developing complex intelligent academic computer projects to solve health system problems, by collaboratively using the Scrum agile method with Python or Java, Spark, NoSQL databases, Kafka, and other technologies.

The solution presented improves overall capital stewardship thru an effective and semi-automated use of data to deliver high quality decisions and improve decision consistency across drilling applications and drive drilling performance. Data science and machine learning is applied to streamline the data preparation process and present to the user a statistically sound drilling assembly solution for the drilling environment input. A large +6000 well database is used to explore alternatives and rank potential solutions using performance and directional compatibility characteristics unique to the Gulf of Thailand. The digital project goal presented is two-fold. The first is to streamline all related data and decision processes in the office to improve work efficiency and information accessibility. The second goal is to improve field drilling performance by installation of a self-learning advisory tool. There is a requirement for multiple sub-processes to work in parallel. The population of data in the database and quality checks must be automated to handle hourly/daily data updates. A system for auto-loading drilling data from rigsite was created. A second system containing data science and machine learning was created to identify similar wells, rank their respective performance and directional compatibility to a future well of interest, and offer a statistically relevant solution recommendation. A benefit of such a system is a more efficient workflow with improved field drilling results while effectively capturing Chevron Thailand methods for many drilling engineers to use in the future.

To attain sustainable competitive advantage from big data, firms must achieve agility in combining rich data across the organization to deploy analytics that sense and respond to customers in a dynamic environment. A key challenge in achieving this agility lies in the identification, collection, and integration of data across functional silos both within and outside the organization. Because it is infeasible to systematically integrate all available data, managers need guidance in finding which data can provide valuable and actionable insights about customers. Leveraging relationship marketing theory, we develop a framework for identifying and evaluating various sources of big data in order to create a value-justified data infrastructure that enables focused and agile deployment of advanced customer analytics. Such analytics move beyond siloed transactional customer analytics approaches of the past and incorporate a variety of rich, relationship-oriented constructs to provide actionable and valuable insights. We develop a customized kernel-based learning method to take advantage of these rich constructs and instantiate the framework in a novel prototype system that accurately predicts a variety of customer behaviors in a challenging environment, demonstrating the framework’s ability to drive significant value.

To facilitate this, organizations should rely upon pliant structures of information, whilst simultaneously continuing to incorporate more rigid infrastructures in order to allow for the collection and analysis of large amounts of both internal and external data. This juxtaposition gives rise to the need for a trade-off. While academic literature has stressed that information systems may represent a burden for organizations pursuing strategic agility, flexibility, and organizational resilience, this paper highlights the ways in which Analytical, Automatic, Adaptive, and Agile information systems - or Big Data Analytics (BDA) capable information systems - may be helpful. In particular, this paper proposes BDA capable information systems, tied with artificial intelligence capabilities, as a trade-off solution. Alongside this, it also proposes some further implications of the topic for scholars and practitioners. © 2018 IADIS Press.

At that time, almost 30 undergraduate and graduate students from 3 different courses within just 17 academic weeks had the opportunity of conceptualizing, modeling, and developing a Computer System based on Big Data, Internet of Things (IoT), and other emerging technologies for government and private organizations. The purpose of this system was to aggregate data from actors such as Patients, Physicians, Hospitals, and Health Care Suppliers, by integrating them into just one decision making process. This academic research project was named in Portuguese as “Soluções Tecnológicas Aplicáveis às Mídias e Produtos em Saúde - STAMPS” meaning in English “Technological Solutions Applicable for Health Care - TSA4HC”. It was planned to allow students to develop health care decision making systems to address crisis management scenarios such as epidemics. Differently from other existing systems from Universities, Research Centers, Governmental Agencies, Public and/or Private, this system was developed and tested in just 17 academic calendar weeks, applying the Scrum agile method and its best practices. This experience was stored in a Google site and implemented as a Proof of Concept (PoC). It represents one example of how to address the old problem of teaching, learning, designing, and implementing complex intelligent systems to solve health care system problems, by collaboratively using the Scrum agile method with Python or Java, Spark, NoSQL databases, Kafka, and other available technologies. © 2019","Agile method; big data; health care system; intelligent systems; interdisciplinarity; Internet of Things; problem-based learning; testing","Agile manufacturing systems; Big data; Decision making; Health care; Intelligent systems; Internet of things; Students; Testing; Agile methods; Decision making process; Health-care system; Interdisciplinarity; Internet of Things (IOT); Private organizations; Problem based learning; Technological solution; Learning systems",,,"Elsevier B.V.",24058963,,,,"English","IFAC-PapersOnLine",Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061136641

Agile Security models different types of security requirements into the context of an attack graph, containing business process targets and critical assets identification, configuration items, and possible impacts of cyber-attacks. By simulating and analyzing virtual adversary attack paths toward cardinal assets, Agile Security examines the business impact on business processes and prioritizes surgical requirements. Thus, handling these requirements backlog that are constantly evaluated as an outcome of employing Agile Security, gradually increases system hardening, reduces business risks and informs the IT service desk or Security Operation Center what remediation action to perform next.

When organisations update and refine their data transformations to meet evolving requirements, it is imperative to ensure that the new version of a workflow still produces the correct output. We motivate the need for workflows and describe the implementation of a validation tool called Diftong. This tool compares two tabular databases resulting from different versions of a workflow to detect and prevent potential unwanted alterations. Row-based and column-based statistics are used to quantify the results of the database comparison. Diftong was shown to provide accurate results in test scenarios, bringing benefits to companies that need to validate the outputs of their workflows. By automating this process, the risk of human error is also eliminated. Compared to the more labour-intensive manual alternative, it has the added benefit of improved turnaround time for the validation process.

Use of big data analytics (BDA) can be a differentiator for organizations seeking to improve agility to quickly sense and respond to novel and complex events. Usage of BDA comprises two types: The routine use and the ad hoc use. The latter is more associated with the unplanned analysis of big data to understand unexpected events, and its effects have not been studied in distinction to the former in the analytics literature. We draw on sensemaking, the organizational theory of the process of understanding novel and complex events, to investigate how the ad hoc use of BDA improves agility of organizations. Analysis of a survey of 107 business executives and senior managers demonstrated the positive effects of the ad hoc use of BDA on agility, through mediation by sensemaking. © 2018 IEEE.","ad hoc use; agility; analytics; big data; sensemaking","Computation theory; Convolutional codes; Data communication systems; ad hoc use; agility; analytics; Big Data Analytics; Business environments; Business executives; Organizational theory; Sensemaking; Big data",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781538630600,,,"English","Int.

Consumers' needs are changing faster than ever before. Textile and garment manufactures are forced to lower the production costs and increase the efficiency so that they can respond quickly when there is a new trend in the market. Big data (BD) has been a hot topic for the last decade; this concept is mainly about extracting valuable information from voluminous data. In the fashion business, big data is playing a more and more important role in trend forecasting, consumer behavior studying etc. This paper reviews the history of conducting business in different developing stages of information technology.

It involved 60 graduate students within just 17 academic weeks. As a starting point for some features of real time Online Transactional Processing (OLTP) system, the Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) MySQL was used along with the NoSQL Cassandra to store transaction data generated from web portal and mobile applications. Considering batch data analysis, the Apache Hadoop Ecosystem was used for Online Analytical Processing (OLAP). The infrastructure based on the Apache Sqoop tool has allowed exporting data from the relational database MySQL to the Hadoop File System (HDFS), while Python scripts were used to export transaction data from the NoSQL database to the HDFS. The main objective of the BDIC-DM project was to implement an e-Commerce prototype system to manage credit card transactions, involving large volumes of data, by using different technologies. The used tools involved generation, storage, and consumption of Big Data. This paper describes the process of integrating NoSQL and relational database with Hadoop Cluster, during an academic project using the Scrum Agile Method.

There is a need for agility in clinical research, and the use of data science to develop predictive models for patient treatment is a potential solution. However, rapidly developing predictive models in healthcare is challenging given the complexity of healthcare problems and the lack of regular interaction between data scientists and physicians. Data scientists can spend significant time working in isolation to build predictive models that may not be useful in clinical environments. We propose the use of an agile data science framework based on the Scrumban framework used in software development. Scrumban is an iterative framework, where in each iteration larger problems are broken down into simple do-able tasks for data scientists and physicians. The two sides collaborate closely in formulating clinical questions and developing and deploying predictive models into clinical settings. Physicians can provide feedback or new hypotheses given the performance of the model, and refinement of the model or clinical questions can take place in the next iteration. The rapid development of predictive models can now be achieved with increasing numbers of publicly available healthcare datasets and easily accessible cloud-based data science tools. What is truly needed are data scientist and physician partnerships ensuring close collaboration between the two sides in using these tools to develop clinically useful predictive models to meet the demands of the COVID-19 healthcare landscape. © 2020 The Authors","Agile; Amazon Web Services; Cloud Computing; Minimal Viable Model; Predictive model; Scrumban",,"Lei, H.; CHOC Children's HospitalUnited States; email: howard.lei@choc.org",,"Elsevier B.V.",26665212,,,,"English","Intell.

Increasingly the Cloud has transcended the boundaries of storage and retrieval and moved into the realms of offering services, performing analytics, undertaking collaborations and much more while ensuring security and privacy of data for the user applications. As a result, deployment of any application or service on the Cloud requires a carefully constructed strategy - especially with respect to managing the dynamicity and balancing of that deployment. This strategic need for Cloud Architecture is further important because of the advent of Big Data and Analytics-as-a-Service (AaaS). The Analytical services utilizing Big Data are not limited to a specific Cloud server. Instead, Big Data Analytics are carried out across the entire spectrum of Internet-based nodes ranging from the back-end Cloud server through to the End-user Internet of Things (IoT) devices and everything in between. The time, location and granularity of Big Data Analytics on and off the Cloud is a crucial strategic question. The Quality of Service (QoS) and security of deployment of Analytics-as-a-Service depends on the key considerations in answering this question. This strategic question relates to the dynamic decision making required to deploy a Cloud-based Big Data Analytics solution – which, in turn, is based on understanding the current conditions – security, volume, performance, criticality, among others – of Cloud-based deployment. The need for automation and intelligence with the dynamic optimization of Analytics on the Cloud requires the application of Machine Learning. This paper explores these key considerations of the strategic aspects of deploying Big Data Analytics using a Cloud Architecture. The practical application of these key considerations is demonstrated through the education domain.

The digital data being created by the educational and research institutions is also on the ascent. The growing interest in recent years toward big data, educational data mining and learning analytics has motivated the development of new analytical ways and approaches and advancements in learning settings. The need for using big data to handle, analyze this large amount of data is prime. This trend has started attracting the interest of educational institutions which have an important role in the development skills process and the preparation of a new generation of learners. “A real revolution for education,” it is based on this kind of terms that many articles have paid attention to big data for learning. How can analytics techniques and tools be so efficient and become a great prospect for the learning process? Big data analytics, when applied into teaching and learning processes, might help to improvise as well as to develop new paradigms. In this perspective, this paper aims to investigate the most promising applications and issues of big data for the design of the next-generation of massive e-learning. Specifically, it addresses the analytical tools and approaches for enhancing the future of e-learning, pitfalls arising from the usage of large data sets. Globally, this paper focuses on the possible application of big data techniques on learning developments, to show the power of analytics and why integrating big data is so important for the learning context. Design/methodology/approach: Big data has in the recent years been an area of interest among innovative sectors and has become a major priority for many industries, and learning sector cannot escape to this deluge. This paper focuses on the different methods of big data able to be used in learning context to understand the benefits it can bring both to teaching and learning process, and identify its possible impact on the future of this sector in general. This paper investigates the connection between big data and the learning context. This connection can be illustrated by identifying the several main analytics approaches, methods and tools for improving the learning process. This can be clearer by the examination of the different ways and solutions that contribute to making a learning process more agile and dynamic. The methods that were used in this research are mainly of a descriptive and analytical nature, to establish how big data and analytics methods develop the learning process, and understand their contributions and impacts in addressing learning issues. To this end, authors have collected and reviewed existing literature related to big data in education and the technology application in the learning context. Authors then have done the same process with dynamic and operational examples of big data for learning. In this context, the authors noticed that there are jigsaw bits that contained important knowledge on the different parts of the research area. The process concludes by outlining the role and benefit of the related actors and highlighting the several directions relating to the development and implementation of an efficient learning process based on big data analytics. Findings: Big data analytics, its techniques, tools and algorithms are important to improve the learning context. The findings in this paper suggest that the incorporation of an approach based on big data is of crucial importance. This approach can improve the learning process, for this, its implementation must be correctly aligned with educational strategies and learning needs. Research limitations/implications: This research represents a reference to better understanding the influence and the role of big data in educational dynamic. In addition, it leads to improve existing literature about big data for learning. The limitations of the paper are given by its nature derived from a theoretical perspective, and the discussed ideas can be empirically validated by identifying how big data helps in addressing learning issues. Originality/value: Over the time, the process that leads to the acquisition of the knowledge uses and receives more technological tools and components; this approach has contributed to the development of information communication and the interactive learning context. Technology applications continue to expand the boundaries of education into an “anytime/anywhere” experience. This technology and its wide use in the learning system produce a vast amount of different kinds of data. These data are still rarely exploited by educational practitioners. Its successful exploitation conducts educational actors to achieve their full potential in a complex and uncertain environment. The general motivation for this research is assisting higher educational institutions to better understand the impact of the big data as a success factor to develop their learning process and achieve their educational strategy and goals. This study contributes to better understand how big data analytics solutions are turned into operational actions and will be particularly valuable to improve learning in educational institutions. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Algorithm; Big data; E-learning; Higher education; Learning analytics; Learning process",,"Sedkaoui, S.; Universite de Khemis MilianaAlgeria; email: soraya.sedkaoui@gmail.com",,"Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.",23986247,,,,"English","Information Discov.

However, traditional data warehouses based on multidimensional models have limitations when it comes to changing and evolving. In recent years, innovative work in the field of data warehouse evolution has been performed; it has mainly focused on the management of big data and the chronological evolution of models in terms of their structures and data. However, an agile decision model is still required. We propose in this paper an agile approach for schema evolution in data warehouses that allows designers to integrate new data sources and take into account new user needs in order to enrich the analysis possibilities of data warehouses in a flexible way. Our approach is based on a multi-version evolutionary schema model. The data instances corresponding to the different versions of the schema are stored in a graph data warehouse. A meta-model will allow the management of the warehouse schema versions. We also propose evolution functions on the schema level. We validate our approach with a software prototype and a case study that illustrates queries on schema versions, cross-queries and the runtime of our approach.

Strategic innovation involves high uncertainties better addressed through agile methods and a collaborative approach [1–3]. Key success factors in delivering ITO/BPO innovation are high-quality relationships, trust and collaborative cultures [1–4], and establishing an effective governance configuration. The authors report on longitudinal case studies of a global mining company (“GMC”) and a group of its suppliers aimed at understanding how GMC is developing “big data” applications to generate game-changing innovation. This paper describes how GMC has developed a “big data” platform to support internal staff, customers, consultants and third party suppliers to create applications that can transform global mining and smelting industries to deliver a price premium for GMC’s products. GMC has encountered a shortage of suitably experienced data scientists in its key operating locations resulting in a significant skills gap in its big data program. GMC’s sourcing strategy aims to build an open and collaborative ecosystem that draws upon secondary markets to help fill the skills gap. To create an environment in which open innovation [5] can flourish, GMC established an Analytics Speed Team (AST) as an internal consulting and program management group to drive faster progress with big data applications. A contribution of this research is to identify the role of AST in establishing an effective governance configuration for open innovation. A practical contribution is made by analysing the value of secondary markets for ITO services in a sourcing ecosystem optimised for delivering innovation. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Artificial intelligence; Big data; Cloud services; Innovation in outsourcing/offshoring; Secondary markets; Sourcing configuration; Sourcing ecosystem; “Gig” economy","Application programs; Big data; Commerce; Ecosystems; Human resource management; Big data applications; Business process outsourcing; Collaborative approach; Key success factors; Longitudinal case study; Program management group; Sourcing strategies; Strategic innovations; Digital storage","Penter, K.; Faculty Business and Law, GPO Box U1987, Australia; email: kevan.penter@team.telstra.com","Oshri I.Kotlarsky J.Willcocks L.P.","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH",18651348,9783030668334,,,"English","Lect.

However, the CI/CD integration requires manual code-revisions and refactoring at large scales. Recently, machine-learning (ML) is employed in SE that allows legacy codes to be highly dynamic, less coupling in related modules, automatic code versioning, and refactoring, with less coupling among related modules. However, over time, ML models tend to become bulky, with increasing monotonic losses during model training. To address this, SE techniques like code revisions are employed over ML codes to allow low-order training losses, that enables seamless and precise workflow structures. Motivated from the aforementioned discussions, the paper presents a systematic review of the close interplay of SE and ML and possible interactions in different applications. Suitable research questions and case studies are presented for possible adoption scenarios that depict the close ML-SE interplay share with each other, with the concluding remarks. The paper forms useful insights for ML engineers, data science practitioners, and SE quality estimators towards the building of efficient and scalable software solutions. © 2020 IEEE.","Effort estimation; Machine learning; Quality estimation; Software Engineering","Data Science; Integration; Security of data; Software quality; Automatic codes; Continuous integrations; Model training; Quality estimation; Research questions; Software solution; Systematic Review; Workflow structures; Machine learning",,"Obaidat M.S.Hsiao K.-F.Nicopolitidis P.Guo Y.Cascado-Caballero D.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781728120355,,,"English","Proc.

The aim is to explore and understand the current mindset of senior decision makers, since their success depends as much on cognitive and behavioral processes as on their technical competences. We adopt a grounded-theory approach, developing models of understanding and belief abductively, driven by the data obtained from participants through a reflection guide. We find that managers differ significantly in their understanding and engagement with their challenges; they display interest but differ in their commitment and enthusiasm; they identify a lack of strategy and skills as current barriers; and they are currently unwilling to trust data, treating evidence according to their own prior commitments.

The key to targeted poverty alleviation lies in providing employment. Employment poverty alleviation is the most direct, realistic and effective way for poor workers to get rid of poverty. How to establish an information communication platform between the poor and enterprises is a key problem to be solved urgently. This paper uses cloud computing, big data and intelligent decision making technology to develop the big data 'Internet plus' platform for precision employment and poverty alleviation. It has solved the problems of asymmetric information among enterprises, the poor and government departments, lack of effective supply and demand docking platform, unbalanced regional distribution of employment posts and labor force, inaccurate employment services, long employment chain and difficult tracking services. This paper describes in detail the architecture design, targeted employment framework process, deployment and implementation for the platform adopting scrum and continuous integration development method. The platform has been successfully online, exploring employment poverty alleviation for about one year, successfully solved the employment of nearly 2,000 poor labor forces and 5,000 needy students in secondary vocational and higher vocational education, cooperated with more than 100 large-scale well-known enterprises in manufacturing, logistics and service industry, formed a systematic targeted employment poverty alleviation model, scheme and experience. Compared with the existing systems in the literature, the advantages and transformation effect of this platform are remarkable.

It helps them to become more agile for improved customer satisfaction and experiences. In the past, real estate businesses had to follow traditional methods by following past trends and professional expertise to make major decisions. Big Data has become much easier to access accurate real data, make conclusions and to even predict future prices of properties. This research uses machine learning algorithms for the appraisal of property prices in New York City. The methods are applied to the data sample of about 80,000 properties, which have sufficient information about each property and its demographic aspects. By further analysis and modelling, it is observed that model with Feature Engineering has performed much better that the model in which Random Forest was implemented.

The Automotive Big Data Pipeline (ABDP) is a big data pipeline base on the automotive use case and is required to scale up agile and high performance in real-time or in batch. Nonetheless, there're many alternative infrastructure designs but lack of knowledge, which fits the best for the automotive domain. It leads this paper into a question: What kinds of infrastructure design could provide better performance for the ABDP?In this paper, we introduce two well-known infrastructure designs called Hyper-Converged infrastructure (HCI) and Disaggregated Hyper-Converged infrastructure (DHCI). HCI combines standard data center hardware using locally attached storage resources to create fast, common building blocks. However, does single standard hardware fit all the requirements? DHCI scale independently from compute and storage provides an option. It provides a more cost-efficient and flexible solution; however, there is no comparison from the performance point of view. Therefore, to address it, our objective is to conduct an empirical performance comparison to see which one performs better.The experiment result shows that DHCI performs almost the same as HCI on CPU utilization, memory, and network consumption. However, regarding storage and running time metrics, DHCI performs slightly higher storage throughput, IOPs, and less running time than HCI. © 2020 IEEE.",,"Big data; Pipelines; Automotive domains; Building blockes; CPU utilization; Empirical performance; Infrastructure design; Performance points; Standard hardware; Storage resources; Digital storage",,"Wu X.Jermaine C.Xiong L.Hu X.T.Kotevska O.Lu S.Xu W.Aluru S.Zhai C.Al-Masri E.Chen Z.Saltz J.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781728162515,,,"English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

Trying to fill this gap, we have developed an improved Agile data mining framework to fulfill the government business objectives and needs. The previous works had been claiming that handling such project is not yet mature in the region. For this an Agile implementation framework is required. We are also proposing a systematic way for identifying business problems as part of the framework. The process is Agile, so it would start from investigating the data set dimensions to identify business problems. It also allows early Business people cooperation with data scientist. We've applied the proposed framework in one of the Middle East government organizations. The business team and the data scientists have been showing their satisfaction regarding the results of using the proposed framework.

They must also support agile exploration of hardware-software co-design, i.e. changes in the programming model, compiler, ISA, and specialized hardware. To meet these challenges, we describe our compiler and simulator pair: DEC++ and MosaicSim. Together, they provide a lightweight, modular simulator for heterogeneous systems, offering accuracy and agility designed specifically for hardware-software co-design explorations. The simulator and corresponding compiler were developed as part of the DECADES project, a multi-team effort to design and tape out a new heterogeneous architecture. We will present two case-studies in important data-science applications where DEC++ and MosaicSim enable straightforward design space explorations for emerging full-stack systems. © 2020 Association on Computer Machinery.","hardware-software co-design.

One of the focal points of the debate is the contrast between the traditional hierarchy structure of C2 organizations and the edge structure. Is the traditional hierarchy structure of C2 necessarily in conflict with the edge structure? Can these two organizational structure models be reconciled to achieve organizational agility transformation? How to reconcile these two models of organizational structure? In order to solve the above problem, we put forward a kind of suitable reconciliation model of agile C2 organization considering our actual situation.

Survival highly depends on the adaptability of SMEs to this ever-changing complex dynamic environment by taking steps in implementing Big Data Analytics as the next frontier for innovation, competition, productivity, and value creation. Based on the grounded theory, this study employed a qualitative method via focus group discussion. Focus groups were conducted with 14 government agencies, SMEs associations, business owners, Chief Operating Officers (CEOs), academic and industrial experts and directors of SMEs in Malaysia. The study revealed the challenges of Malaysian SMEs in adopting Big Data Analytics Capability, presents the criticality of Big Data Analytics Capability to overcome the identified challenges, and develops a BDA Capability Ecosystem Model that integrates the internal enablers, external barriers and support to explain the adoption of BDA Capability for value creation and support the decision-making process. This paper is followed by some policy suggestions for companies’ owners, policymakers, government agencies, universities, and SMEs. This study directly impacts Malaysia’s economy as a whole by addressing Malaysia’s Shared Prosperity Vision 2030. This research contributes to industries that are still in the low value added category with low adoption of technology. Furthermore, it will ultimately lead to the realization of SMEs as ‘game changers’ to transition the economy to a high-income nation. This study proposes a model that could help SMEs improve their value creation performance, directly influencing the country’s GDP and employability. © 2022 by the authors.","Big Data Analytics; business model; capability; competencies; SMEs; value creation","business; COVID-19; decision making; decision support system; ecosystem modeling; policy approach; small and medium-sized enterprise; technology adoption; Malaysia","Falahat, M.; Centre for Entrepreneurial Sustainability, Sungai Long Campus, Malaysia; email: falahat@utar.edu.my",,"MDPI",20711050,,,,"English","Sustainability",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85146036098

This tool is using machine learning (ML) models which are fed by historic data and will notify engineers and operators when operating conditions are trending beyond the operating envelope, which enables an operator to mitigate upcoming performance problems. In addition to traditional engineering methods, such a system will capture knowledge by continuous improvement based on ML. With this approach the engineer has a system at hand to support the day-to-day work. Manual monitoring and on demand investigations are now backed up by an intelligent system which permanently monitors the equipment. In order to create such a system, a proof of concept (PoC) study has been initiated with industry partners and data scientists to evaluate historic events, which are used to train the ML-systems. This phase aims to better understand the capabilities of machine learning and data science in the subsurface domain as well as to build up trust for the engineers with such systems. The concept evaluation has shown that the intensive collaboration between engineers and data scientist is essential. A continuous and structured exchange between engineering and data science resulted in a mutual developed product, which fits the engineer's needs based on the technical capabilities and limits set by ML-models. To organize such a development, new project management elements like agile working methods, sprints and scrum methods were utilized. During the development Wintershall Dea has partnered with two organizations. One has a pure data science background and the other one was the data science team of the ESP manufacturer. After the PoC period the following conclusions can be derived: (1) data quality and format is key to success; (2) detailed knowledge of the equipment speeds up the development and the quality of the results; (3) high model accuracy requires a high number of events in the training dataset. The overall conclusion of this PoC is that the collaboration between engineers and data scientists, fostered by the agile project management toolkit and suitable datasets, leads to a successful development. Even when the limits of the ML-algorithms are hit, the model forecast, in combination with traditional engineering methods, adds significant value to the ESP performance. The novelty of such a system is that the production engineer will be supported by trusted ML-models and digital systems. This system in combination with the traditional engineering tools improves monitoring of the equipment and taking decisions leading to increased equipment performance. © Copyright 2021, Society of Petroleum Engineers",,"Engineers; Information management; Intelligent systems; Machine learning; Oil fields; Project management; Submersible pumps; Digital system; Electrical submersible pumps; Engineering methods; Machine learning models; Performance based; Performance monitoring systems; Proof of concept; Pump performance; Traditional engineerings; Wintershall; Monitoring",,,"Society of Petroleum Engineers",,9781613998342,,,"English","Soc.

These business models are developed to manage the internal operations within the company through adopting complex formulae and algorithms to reduce the waste at each procedure. However in today's fashion business market, global sourcing and global corporation are much more important than before. The relationship between the fashion company and its suppliers, the relationship between the fashion company and its customers, and the management of these relationships. All of them are crucial parts in the business strategy. The competition between fashion companies is no longer in company level but instead is supply chain versus supply chain. Trying to take the massive information into consideration by using traditional digital technology is not a wise decision when developing business strategy. Further thinking, the information flow through the supply chain has the same characteristics \5Vs""as big data: Volume, Velocity, Variety, Value and Veracity. Put another word: the management of information flow in supply chain is the management of big data. There is no doubt that the digital technology under big data environment will fundamentally change the whole supply chain. The first objective of this paper is to identify the key weakness of lean and agile logistic supply chain models in literature. The second objective is to point out the technology challenges to develop the Tomorrow's models which build an agile response upon a lean platform: How to set up virtual networks from the early designing stage to the last consuming and feedback stage? How to set up the information standardization and synchronisation process in the system? How to specify the consumer requirements in fitting effects and functional performance of garments? The last objective is to discover the digital technology under big data environment which enable the information e±ciently to flow through the whole supply chain.

The level of autonomy is improving by means of Internet-of-Things (IoT), while the level of intelligence is improving through artificial intelligence. The applications of big data analytics and cloud computing techniques in smart grids are also new topics, which have been paid particular attention recently. These paradigms can be used in both grid-scale and local-scale, while the central grid operation center has interoperability with an abundant number of sub-controllers, and aggregators in a wide variety of scales. On the one hand, the system operator must deal with multiple parameters with different kinds of uncertainties. On the other hand, the new structures are evolving toward transactive energy trading models in microgrids. In such a circumstance, a myriad of elements is producing critical data, which should be acquired, transferred, stored, analyzed, and finally, proper controlling actions must be sent. These data are producing at different intervals, even in a fraction of a second. This matter makes it possible to maintain grid security and better real-time operation as well as to get better demand responsiveness. A smart grid consists of many embedded or interconnected systems that are linked to each other through various communication platforms in the cyber layer. A flexible, highly-autonomous, and intelligent smart grid entails an agile communication system, whether wired or wireless. However, cellular networks have prominent benefits. Hence, 5G technology, which is state-of-the-art technology in this field, can be deployed. The communication infrastructure links many components to each other in cyber-physical smart grids. The velocity of data exchange has a profound importance for some purposes, while 5G technology can be the best solution.

However, implementing and maintaining a DSL incurs a significant effort which limits their utility in context of fast-changing data science frameworks and libraries. We propose an approach and a Python-based library/tool NLDSL which simplifies and streamlines implementation of DSLs modeling pipelines of operations. In particular, syntax description and operation implementation are bundled together as annotated and terse Python functions, which simplifies extending and maintaining a DSL. To support ad hoc DSL elements, NLDSL offers a mechanism to define DSLlevel functions as first-class DSL elements. Our tool automatically supports each DSL by code completions and in-editor documentation in a multitude of IDEs implementing the Microsoft's Language Server Protocol. To circumvent the problem of a limited expressiveness of a external DSL, our tool allows embedding DSL statements in the source code comments of a general purpose language and to translate the DSL to such a language during editing. We demonstrate and evaluate our approach and tool by implementing a DSL for data tables which is translated to either Pandas or to PySpark code. A preliminary evaluation shows that this DSL can be defined in a concise and maintainable way, and that it can cover a majority of processing steps of popular Spark/Pandas tutorials.

For many of these projects, large-scale and heterogeneous datasets, multidisciplinary and dispersed experts, and advanced technologies are brought together to harness analytic insights. However, without effective CI and computational tools, the accuracy and meaningfulness of analytics results are compromised. In fact, without CI tools, raw data remain raw with hidden insights, as data analytics cannot be executed at all. In order to improve such tools for meaningful results, we argue to conceptualize the communication mechanism of 'feedback' in agile software development, with the goal of producing CI tools that are responsive to users. Based on a grounded analysis of interview data, we concluded that feedback helps developers in big data projects understand users' needs, makes tools user-friendly, prevents emergencies, and is better for developers than no feedback. Furthermore, good feedback is often structured, specific, actionable, timely, generalizable, and delivered in a tactful way. Despite the limitation of the findings being exploratory and yet to be evaluated experimentally, we argued that they still can motivate developers to be proactive seekers of feedback for their tools, productively guide developers' communication with users, and ultimately promote further adoption and diffusion of CI tools in e-science. © 2018 IEEE.","agile software development; cyberinfrastructure; diffusion of innovations; e-science; feedback; technology adoption","Data Analytics; Diffusion; Feedback; Software design; Agile software development; Cyber infrastructures; Diffusion of innovations; E-sciences; Technology adoption; Large dataset",,"Song Y.Liu B.Lee K.Abe N.Pu C.Qiao M.Ahmed N.Kossmann D.Saltz J.Tang J.He J.Liu H.Hu X.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781538650356,,,"English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

These business models are developed to manage the internal operations within the company through adopting complex formulae and algorithms to reduce waste at each procedure. However in today's fashion business market, global sourcing and global corporation are much more important than before. The relationship between the fashion company and its suppliers, the relationship between the fashion company and its customers, and the management of these relationships: all of them are critical components of an effective business strategy. The competition between fashion companies is no longer on a company level but instead is subjected to supply chain versus supply chain. Trying to take the massive information into consideration by using traditional digital technology is not a wise decision when developing business strategy. On further thinking, the information flow through the supply chain has the same characteristics ""5Vs"" as big data: Volume, Velocity, Variety, Value and Veracity. In other words, the management of information flow in supply chain is the management of big data. There is no doubt that digital technology under the big data environment will fundamentally change the whole supply chain. The first objective of this paper is to identify the key weakness of lean and agile logistic supply chain models in literature. The second objective is to point out the technological challenges in developing Tomorrow's models to build an agile response with a lean platform: How to set up virtual networks from the early designing stage to the last consuming and feedback stage? How to set up the information standardization and synchronisation process in the system? How to specify the consumer requirements in fitting effects and functional performance of garments? The last objective is to discover the digital technology under big data environment which will enable the information to efficiently flow through the whole supply chain. © 2018 Binary Information Press.

The available datasets are mostly small and unbalanced, resulting in non-optimal classification when the algorithms are implemented. In this study, five novel machine learning experiments are conducted to address the challenges of small datasets by expanding these into big data and then utilising Random Forests. The experiments are based on personalised adaptable strategies for both balanced and unbalanced datasets. Multiple datasets from cryotherapy and immunotherapy are considered, however, hereby only immunotherapy is used. In the first experiment, artificially generated data is presented by increasing the observations of the dataset, each new data is four-time larger than the previous one, resulting in better classification. In the second experiment, the effect of volume on classification is considered based on the number of attributes. The attributes of each new dataset are built based on conditional probabilities. It did not make any difference, in obtained classification, when the number of attributes is increased to more than 879. In the third simulation experiment, classes of data are classified manually by dividing the data into a two-dimensional plane. This experiment is first performed on small data and then on expanded big data: by increasing observations, an accuracy of 73.68% is attained. In the fourth experiment, the visualisation of the enlarged data did not provide better insights. In the fifth experiment, the impact of correlations among datasets' attributes on classification is observed, however, no improvements in performance are achieved. The experiments generally improved performance by comparing the classification results using the original and artificial data. © 2022 IEEE.","Big data; Classification; Cryotherapy; Health-care; Immunotherapy; Machine learning; Random Forests; Warts","Classification (of information); Decision support systems; Large dataset; Machine learning; Adaptable strategies; Decision supports; Immunotherapy; Machine-learning; Optimal classification; Performance; Random forests; Small data set; Useful patterns; Wart; Health care","Yunas Mahmoud, A.; University of Bradford, United Kingdom; email: A.Y.Mahmoud@bradford.ac.uk","Wani M.A.Kantardzic M.Palade V.Neagu D.Yang L.Chan K.-Y.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781665462839,,,"English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

Industry 4.0 changes the way that value creation transformed towards personalised product development. Industries and business sectors have faced challenges to improve customer satisfaction while there is a continuously growing demand for product personalisation worldwide. To address affordable personalisation, there are limited studies about how Industry 4.0 could bring significant value to personalisation at scale. Affordable personalisation is one of the ultimate goals to achieve in the era of Industry 4.0. The high customer demand and industrial completion encouraged almost all business sectors to meet customer’s requirements with the cost near to mass production. This paper investigates an agile methodology for mass personalisation under Industry 4.0. The cutting-edge Industry 4.0 technologies for personalisation, in addition to product development and personalisation, has been reviewed. Agile product development along with Cloud-enabled customer profile (CCP), personalised customer backlog (PCB), personalised product backlog (PPB), augmented, and 3D printing prototyping for personalisation has been proposed. A case study for personalised facial mask has been presented by using the Internet of Things (IoT), Big data, additive manufacturing (AM), augmented reality (AR) and Cloud technologies through an iterative and incremental process. Finally, the challenges and future perspectives have been identified. This study leads to a sustainable development approach when developing mass personalisation as a service. In this paper, the proposed methodology has been validated by using augmented reality and 3D printing based prototyping, which has been achieved by measuring performance through Big data and Edge computing.

The need for performance improvements that can directly improve the quality of inpatient health services is a major problem. The role of doctors and nurses' knowledge becomes a benchmark in determining the performance and quality of services, in this case the Knowledge Management System (KMS) can be a solution in supporting the knowledge management process. However, the growth of innovation in knowledge management is also needed in practice. So Big Data as a large data processing technology and various types of data will be a supporter in the process of increasing and accelerating the growth of knowledge of doctors and nurses at the XYZ ISLAMIC HOSPITAL by providing relevant information as needed. Then it is necessary to design a KMS that uses Big data as one of the enablers in the process of creating knowledge for doctors and nurses and then can be stored and shared. This design is done by using the Knowledge Management System Agile Implementation Methodology (KMSAIM) which prioritizes the initiation process in each problem domain so that each component has the right and relevant solutions.

Most of the business and enterprises already acquire cloud storage as their mainstream solution for data processing. These mainstream solution are already struggling with limited infrastructure of cloud computing. In day to day business processes large amount of data is generated and these data are migrated on cloud at the end of day. Today’s cloud enables data processing, storage and distribution, system are not competent for moving large amounts of data in and out of the cloud. This actually is nothing but challenge for organizations with terabytes of digital content and managing cloud infrastructure for their daily real-time data crunching operation on demand. A high speed transport solution is required for transforming agility of on demand cloud infrastructure and merging big data analytics. Researchers need to developed such kind of mechanism where progressive data will be transferred on cloud with limited infrastructure of cloud computing. Today data migration is still carried out by managing hardware and dumping data on that hardware. No online solution and mechanism which can take care of this progressive data is available. Traditional hardware moving approach i.e. dumping data in hard drive or copy data in to magnetic tape and then transfer this data to cloud enable environment manually have many challenges associated it. In this paper we tried to explore opportunity of migrating big data to cloud infrastructure in optimized way. First part of this research work is discussing traditional data migration techniques and second part is experimenting these traditional data migration techniques on simulation based environment with ORTm algorithm which is modified version of ORT (Optimal Response Time).

Such disparity is apparent in the domain of health and human services, as government organizations are grappling with the challenge of streamlining their business processes and delivery of care to adhere to a person-centered approach that relies on interoperable systems and meaningful data exchange. Since 2014, the Georgia Tech Research Institute has supported the U.S. Department of the Army in this endeavor by modernizing a suite of information systems used to provide family-centric social services, in support of family readiness and inclusive of child wellbeing, healthy marriages and parenting, and the treatment and prevention of domestic violence and child abuse. In this paper, we discuss how agile software development methodology on its own is not conducive to modernization efforts where legacy systems, data, and human processes cannot be replaced entirely. Instead, the authors propose an adapted model that combines agile development with enhanced usercentered design techniques as a socio-Technical approach to software modernization. We will describe our process, reflect on lessons learned, and discuss select future implications associated with this type of work. '.

The paper suggests BDA APIs architecture as helping tool for formative assessors. It helps them effectively produce and adapt visual diagnostic reports for FA-actions in agile based requirements (i.e. features) definition. The paper presents two core architectures: Architecture for a parametrized feature-descriptor-system to define/refine a BDA API feature and its visual diagnostic reports, and an initial resources architecture for BDA API to initialize an analytics algorithm with its input big data sets. Clarifying visually the trainee's challenges (i.e. incremental features in a BDA API) is our main FA action. The FA action is designed based on Csikszentmihalyi's flow model to support a trainee in matching balance between his/her challenges and his/her skills. To test the architecture's functions, the paper has test setups for two formal projects (each has 1 to 6 trainees) and two informal projects (each has 1 to 3 trainees). The projects are to attack BDA problems in learning analytics and in image automatic classification. The test results show that the visual diagnostic reports produced by the trainers are very effective in clarifying visually incremental BDA API features not only for simple classifiers (i.e. classical data mining algorithms) but also for complex classifiers (i.e. deep learning algorithms). The results show also how visual diagnostic reports are easily produced for comparing the algorithm performances using different input big data sets, whereas other reports are produced for comparing performances between different algorithms, using one input data set. Related works are also discussed to show the architecture's differences and advantages. Its main advantages are: 1) it enables the trainers to use deep learning algorithms beside classical data mining algorithms in its BDA API parameterizable feature descriptors for visual diagnostic reports. 2) The descriptors can be extended, reused, shared, and scaled out to help trainers in other universities providing flow model based FA actions. 3) Finally, it has extensions to integrate other theoretical frameworks like Buckingham Shum and Deakin Crick's framework for dispositional learning analytics instead of the used flow model. © 2021 IEEE.","assessment in engineering education; Big Data Analytics; planning for formative assessment","Big data; Classification (of information); Computer architecture; Data Analytics; Data mining; Data visualization; Learning algorithms; Analytic problem; Assessment in engineering education; Data mining algorithm; Descriptor systems; Diagnostic Report; Feature descriptors; Flow modelling; Formative assessment; Planning for formative assessment; Visual diagnostics; Deep learning",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",15394565,9781665438513,PFECD,,"English","Proc.

Despite unparalleled technological innovation such as cloud computing, blockchain technology, and big data functional capabilities to drive real implementation of regional economic integration in Africa, the status quo remains with minor evidence of an agile continental and integrated commerce and financial services. Hence, this study argued that economic integration is a viable and alternative approach to achieve a United States of Africa with an integrated financial and economic architecture to foster regional integration. It employed a bibliometric review as an agile methodology to map knowledge trajectories of regional integration. The findings revealed gaps in the literature and lack of focus on the part of the African Union on how to replace the current sub-regional cooperation among the six clusters of economic communities of Africa with effective regional integration. The lack of, and the inability to utilize and align technological innovation to drive regional integration would make achieving this an arduous task. This study recommended that a business and IT alignment approach should be adopted in implementing African economic integration. © 2020 Adonis and Abbey Publishers Ltd.

The focus of this paper was on visualization as a crucial tool in presenting complex raw data and modelling results to provide easy-to-understand actionable information that facilitate decision-making. However, limited research distinguished between 'data visualization' and 'model visualization', which has been clearly made in this paper. Furthermore, this paper aimed to shed light on the importance of interactive visualizations to compliment statistical data modelling using R and Shiny for its advanced capabilities. Specifically, a methodology has been proposed based on a hybrid development lifecycle that adopts the Agile Software Development Lifecycle and the Data Analytics Lifecycle. Finally, by presenting a case study to model the dynamics of COVID-19, it was found that R and Shiny alongside the proposed hybrid development lifecycle significantly reduced the amount of time required to build visually interactive applications. The reported results highlighted the effectiveness of the adopted approach in assisting and guiding researchers and developers in building interactive applications that leverage Big Data Analytics. © 2021 IEEE.","Data Analytics; Interactive Applications; R; Shiny; Visualization","Big data; Data Analytics; Data visualization; Decision making; Interactive devices; Life cycle; Software design; Statistical methods; Analytic tools; Data analytics; Decisions makings; Interactive applications; Interactive visualizations; Modeling results; R; Shiny; Statistic modeling; Visualization tools; Visualization",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781665416566,,,"English","Int.

It has attracted a lot of attention from universities and industry. To meet this challenge, semantic analysis of textual data is the subject matter. Today, with the connection present everywhere and at any time, considerable data is born. These data or data become a key player for understanding, analyzing, anticipating and solving major economic, political, social and scientific problems. Data also changes our working procedures, our cultural environment, even restructuring our way of thinking. And just as the scientific, managerial and financial world is interested in Big Data, a new discipline is growing: Fast Data. In addition to the salient volume of data; another variant becomes decisive, the ability to efficiently process data in all their diversity, transforming it into knowledge by providing the right information to the right person at the right time, or even using it to predict the future. The exploitation of Big Data requires the proposition of new adapted mathematical and IT approaches but also a reengineering of managerial approaches for the control of the informational environment of a public or private organization. While basing itself on a strategic information management approach such as Economic Intelligence (EI). The latter combines and encompasses Business Intelligence techniques for internal data management and business intelligence techniques for monitoring and controlling external information flows. However, Big Data, as a boundless source of information for EI, has upset the traditional EI process, which requires a reengineering of the EI approach. My research works perfectly in this context characterized by an uncertain and unpredictable environment. We ask to propose an ontology-based, service-oriented, agile and scalable Social Business Intelligence approach to extract the semantics of textual data and define the domain of massive data. In other words, we semantically analyze social data at two levels, namely the level of the entity and the level of the domain. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","Big Data; Cloud; Distributed Processing; Fast Data; Ontology; Social BI","Advanced Analytics; Big data; Clouds; Data Analytics; Data handling; Information management; Internet of things; Managers; Metadata; Ontology; Reengineering; Semantics; Distributed environments; Distributed processing; External informations; Fast Data; Monitoring and controlling; Private organizations; Strategic information management; Unpredictable environments; Data mining",,,"Association for Computing Machinery",,9781450372404,,,"English","ACM Int.

There exist a multitude of tools to monitor user activities on a website, which then provide metrics to help developers and company leadership understand where their users experience pain-points. However, all tools suffer from their own limitations and ultimately it is important for companies to have as much control (as possible) over all data collected by third-party tools, and be able to make decisions related to its storage, retention, processing, etc., in an agile manner. At Dottid, we use a third-party tool to understand and enhance the user experience on our web application, recently however, we ran into a problem regarding failed logins that required us to architect a solution ourselves, since the tool cannot address this issue for us. The solution leverages log collection and big data analytics and its architecture has paved the way for us to build more actionable insights than if we were using the tool as-is.

The paper documents research that links various capabilities and wastes, including how IIoT can be used to reduce defects in manufacturing, and how it can mitigate overproduction across industries. There is also evidence that big data implementation in manufacturing has positive effects on reducing waiting times across the manufacturing process and delivery, and that cloud computing techno logies guarantee better estimates for product and predicted inventory amounts. The research finds impacts on the social aspect of manufacturing by how augmented reality tools are increasingly used in the manufacturing sector to improve workers' knowledge, skills, and abili ties, and that simulation software applications are capable of decreasing operator motion wastes.

With the broadcast industry moving to all-IP and data center deployments those environments are more agile and complex than ever before. With fast-evolving technologies and cycles, ever more mission critical systems and constantly changing operational practices and devops style operations, traditional network management systems (NMS) and their paradigms don't fit the bill anymore. This paper explores why machine-learning algorithms must find their way into network monitoring and management solutions to orchestrate a modern media data center dynamically and in a proactive way. The foundation for an AI-driven NMS platform is a solid big data storage architecture; a lack of profound data and data hygiene is often one of the biggest obstacles to successfully deploy big data projects.

In contrast to human sources, i.e. stakeholders, digital sources continuously generate data that is often not originally created for the purposes of requirements elicitation, e.g. on forums, microblogs, machine-generated trace logs, and sensor data. Streams of large volumes of data can be exploited to enable automation of a continuous requirements elicitation process using AI techniques that combine natural language or machine data processing, with machine learning. On the other hand, the complex characteristics of big data due to its size, lack of structure, high dynamics, and low predictability, present numerous challenges on the process of extracting requirements-related information that would be of a clear value for companies. The purpose of this interview study was to, from the practitioners' perspective, elicit their overall expectations and needs for a method for the elicitation of system requirements from digital data sources. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with several industrial experts from different business domains and the collected empirical data has been analyzed using thematic analysis. The results lead to the identification of a set of high-level requirements related to the method for the elicitation from digital data sources. © 2021 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

The skills of a Scrum team largely determine the successful implementation of Scrum in a GSD project. The present study aims to identify and rank the essential skills for Scrum GSD teams. First, we identified five hard skills and five soft skills by conducting a literature study and depth interviews with a software engineering expert. Second, these skills were arranged into a questionnaire, which was then distributed to thirty undergraduate students taking software engineering subjects. The students were considered as Scrum beginners in development teams. The questionnaire data were subsequently analyzed by ranking the importance of the skills. Next, the rankings were validated in a focus group discussion (FGD) with four practitioners, two academics, one policymaker, and one representative of a relevant professional association. All members of the FGD had at least five years of experience in Scrum GSD. In the following stage, frequency analysis was employed to achieve a consensus among the experts. After that, a round table discussion was conducted to confirm the consensus. The results show that programming is the most important hard skill, while interpersonal and communication are the most important soft skills. Database expertise and leadership were identified as the least important hard and soft skills, respectively. Furthermore, the rank of these skills by importance is aligned with the nature of Scrum and GSD. Our findings can be used as a foundation to construct competencies in Scrum GSD teams. © 2020 Association for Computing Machinery.","Global Software Development; Hard Skills; Scrum GSD Team; Soft Skills","Big data; Information management; Software design; Surveys; Frequency Analysis; Global software development; Hard Skills; Professional associations; Questionnaire data; Scrum GSD Team; Soft skills; Undergraduate students; Students","Purwandari, B.; Faculty of Computer Science, Indonesia; email: bettyp@cs.ui.ac.id",,"Association for Computing Machinery",,9781450376907,,,"English","ACM Int.

In this work we analyze smart learning concepts that are leading to a new emerging scenario in which the distinction between learning and working activities is dynamic and in evolution. In particular we present an integrated smart learning model called EcoPolytechnic which aims to redesigns the organization model of a Polytechnic by introducing several concepts of agile learning and project-based learning. The model is built upon the notion of smart learning cell that replaces in a flexible and sustainable way the notion of set of courses and can be used in a better way in smart learning scenarios. The result is a complete and easy to be configured smart learning organization system for which a comparative analysis is carried out.

By analyzing Big Data streams generated through Internet of Things (IoT) devices, this paper aims to show the efficiency of using IoT analytics, as an agile optimization input for solving real-time problems in smart cities. IoT analytics has become the main core of large-scale Internet applications, however, its utilization in optimization approaches for real-time configuration and dynamic conditions of a smart city has been less discussed. The challenging research topic is how to reach real-time IoT analytics for use in optimization approaches. In this paper, we consider integrating IoT analytics into agile optimization problems. A realistic waste collection problem is modeled as a dynamic team orienteering problem with mandatory visits. Open data repositories from smart cities are used for extracting the IoT analytics to achieve maximum advantage under the city environment condition. Our developed methodology allows us to process real-time information gathered from IoT systems in order to optimize the vehicle routing decision under dynamic changes of the traffic environments. A series of computational experiments is provided in order to illustrate our approach and discuss its effectiveness. In these experiments, a traditional static approach is compared against a dynamic one. In the former, the solution is calculated only once at the beginning, while in the latter, the solution is re-calculated periodically as new data are obtained. The results of the experiments clearly show that our proposed dynamic approach outperforms the static one in terms of rewards. © 2022 by the authors.

Many studies highlight how to rapidly make or change the plans with detecting advance information. One of the widely used solutions is to evaluate the agile organization's decision-making capability based the time-domain metrics. However, the dynamic assignment capability always changed during task operating within time-domain. It caused that the planning used the wrong organization capability in the most time. In this paper, we develop an improved simulated annealing algorithm to address this problem. In order to discretize the time-domain, we propose a horizon partition that is based on the task dynamic state. Finally, the optimization model is tested in a toy example.

These disasters play an important role in mobilizing several organizations to counteract them, but the organizations often find it hard to strike a fine balance between agility and resilience. Operations Management Scholars’ opinion remains divided between responsiveness and efficiency. However, to manage unexpected events like disasters, organizations need to be agile and resilient. In previous studies, scholars have adopted the resource-based view or dynamic capability view to explain the combination of resources and capabilities (i.e., technology, agility, and resilience) to explain their performance. However, following some recent scholarly debates, we argue that organizational theories like the resource-based view or dynamic capability view are not suitable enough to explain humanitarian supply chain performance. As the underlying assumptions of the commercial supply chain do not hold true in the case of the humanitarian supply chain. We note this as a potential research gap in the existing literature. Moreover, humanitarian organizations remain sceptical regarding the adoption of artificial intelligence-driven big data analytics capability (AI-BDAC) in the decision-making process. To address these potential gaps, we grounded our theoretical model in the practice-based view which is proposed as an appropriate lens to examine the role of practices that are not rare and are easy to imitate in performance. We used Partial Least Squares (PLS) to test our theoretical model and research hypotheses, using 171 useable responses gathered through a web survey of international non-governmental organizations (NGOs). The findings of our study suggest that AI-BDAC is a significant determinant of agility, resilience, and performance of the humanitarian supply chain. Furthermore, the reduction of the level of information complexity (IC) on the paths joining agility, resilience, and performance in the humanitarian supply chain. These results offer some useful theoretical contributions to the contingent view of the practice-based view. In a way, we have tried to establish empirically that the humanitarian supply chain designs are quite different from their commercial counterparts. Hence, the use of a resource-based view or dynamic capability view as theoretical lenses may not help capture true perspectives. Thus, the use of a practice-based view as an alternative theoretical lens provides a better understanding of humanitarian supply chains. We have further outlined the limitations and the future research directions of the study. © 2022","Artificial intelligence; Big data analytics; Culture; Humanitarian operations management; Humanitarian supply chain; PLS-SEM; Practice-based view; Supply chain agility; Supply chain resilience","Artificial intelligence; Big data; Computational complexity; Decision making; Disasters; Least squares approximations; Supply chains; Big data analytic; Culture; Data analytics; Humanitarian operation management; Humanitarian operations; Humanitarian supply chain; Operation management; Partial least square-SEM; Partial least-squares; Practice-based view; Supply chain agility; Supply chain resiliences; Data Analytics","Dubey, R.; Liverpool Business School, Merseyside, United Kingdom; email: r.dubey@montpellier-bs.com",,"Elsevier B.V.",09255273,,IJPCE,,"English","Int J Prod Econ",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138517376

This new era of AI, under the project name IBM Z Development Transformation (zDT), has allowed the team to grow and learn new skills in data science. This transformation forces change structurally in how data is prepared and stored. In z14, there were incremental productivity gains with enhancements to automation with eServer Automation Test Solution and a technology data analysis engine called zDataAssist. However, in z15, AI will significantly accelerate our efficiency. This article explains how Design Thinking and Agile principles were used to identify areas that are of high impact and feasible to implement: 1) what and how data is collected via System Test Event Logging and Analysis engine, Problem ticket management system (Jupitr), and Processor data analysis engine (Xrings); 2) problem identification, analysis, and management (AutoJup) along with Intelligent Recovery Verification Assistant; 3) product design documentation search engine (AskTheMachine); and 4) prototype microprocessor allocation processes Intelligent Commodity Fulfillment System using Machine Learning.

These trends present new challenges for simulation-based performance assessments that are central to early-stage architectural exploration. Simulators must be lightweight to support rich heterogeneous combinations of general purpose cores and specialized processing units. They must also support agile exploration of hardware-software co-design, i.e. changes in the programming model, compiler, ISA, and specialized hardware. To meet these challenges, we introduce MosaicSim, a lightweight, modular simulator for heterogeneous systems, offering accuracy and agility designed specifically for hardware-software co-design explorations. By integrating the LLVM toolchain, MosaicSim enables efficient modeling of instruction dependencies and flexible additions across the stack. Its modularity also allows the composition and integration of different hardware components. We first demonstrate that MosaicSim captures architectural bottlenecks in applications, and accurately models both scaling trends in a multicore setting and accelerator behavior. We then present two case-studies where MosaicSim enables straightforward design space explorations for emerging systems, i.e. data science application acceleration and heterogeneous parallel architectures. © 2020 IEEE.","accelerators; hardware-software co design; heterogeneity; multi-core architectures; performance modeling","Data Science; Image coding; Parallel architectures; Program compilers; Simulators; Software design; Design space exploration; Hardware components; Heterogeneous systems; Modular simulator; Programming models; Science applications; Simulation-based performance assessments; Specialized hardware; Hardware-software codesign",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781728147987,,,"English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

Story-point estimation enables software development teams to, among other things, better scope products, prioritize requirements, allocate resources and measure progress. Several machine learning techniques have been proposed for automated story-point estimation. However, most of these techniques use open-source projects for evaluation. There are important differences between open-source and commercial projects with respect to story authoring. The goal of this paper is to evaluate a state-of-the-art machine learning technique, known as Deep-SE [3], for estimating story points in a commercial project. Our dataset is comprised of 4,727 stories for a data anonymization product developed by a 27-member agile team at a healthcare data science company, IQVIA. Over this dataset, Deep-SE achieved a mean absolute error of 1.46, significantly better than three different baselines. Model performance nonetheless varied across stories, with the estimation error being larger for stories that had higher points. Our results further indicate that model performance is correlated with certain story characteristics such as the level of detail and the frequency of vague terms in the stories. An important take-away from our study is that, before organizations attempt to introduce machine learning-based estimation into agile development, they need to better embrace agile best practices, particularly in relation to story authoring and expert-based estimation. © 2021 IEEE.","Agile Development; Machine Learning; Story-point Estimation","Deep learning; Open source software; Software design; Agile development; Agile software engineering; Commercial projects; Industrial experience; Machine learning techniques; Machine-learning; Modeling performance; Open source projects; Point estimation; Story-point estimation; Learning algorithms",,"Yue T.Mirakhorli M.","IEEE Computer Society",1090705X,9781665418980,,,"English","Proc.

Musicians and music scholars alike normally evaluate such parameters visually by departing from scores, which present the musical events at once. Yet for the under-standing of such symbolic representations, musical training is essential, making scores mostly incomprehensible for amateurs. Data visualisation has been applied to meaningfully represent complex musical parameters, thus enabling music amateurs to grasp concepts such as texture or structure. Although scores are one of the ""primary""sources to understand music, previous work shows a strong bias towards the visualisation of acoustic data, in detriment of the visualisation of symbolic information. To bridge the gap, we present SymPlot, a web-based open source tool to automatically visualise textural density, scoring, and structure from MusicXML files. Due to the multidisciplinary nature of the topic, in this project we have applied the Scrum's agile methodology, an iterative incremental approach specifically tailored for interdisciplinary projects. The tool, aimed at enhancing musical understanding in amateurs and students, as well as in scholars of other disciplines who need to incorporate music into their discourses, i.e., historians, philologists, etc., enables visualisation of local features at various hierarchical levels, highlighting similarities both within and across scores. Our evaluation of SymPlot-based on a five-level rating-scale test performed by 50 participants-suggests that colours increase users' understanding of complex musical parameters. © 2020 IEEE.","computational musicology; data science; digital humanities; music; score; symbolic music data; visualisation","Data visualization; Iterative methods; Textures; Agile Methodologies; Hierarchical level; Incremental approach; Interdisciplinary project; Musical events; Musical parameters; Open source tools; Symbolic representation; Visualization",,"Banissi E.Khosrow-Shahi F.Ursyn A.McK.

Using this criteria, we assessed a sample of GIScience studies from the Association of Geographic Information Laboratories in Europe (AGILE) conference series, and we collected feedback about the assessment from the study authors. Results from the author feedback indicate that although authors support the concept of performing reproducible research, the incentives for doing this in practice are too small. Therefore, we propose concrete actions for individual researchers and the GIScience conference series to improve transparency and reproducibility.

Nowadays containers deliver the flexibility to handle many software environments and tasks in a lighter-weight virtualization scheme, providing a more agile alternative to virtual machines for certain applications. Application checkpointing coupled with a container manager allows the live migration of a container. In this work, we present Herd-Monitor, a resource monitoring system to gather performance metrics of containers and their respective compute hosts. This data can be used to analyze the utilization of available resources, characterize workloads, and develop forecast models. With the analysis of the data provided by the monitoring system, we can fine-tune resource provisioning policies, with the end goal of constructing a cloud resource provisioning platform that enables an improvement in usage and execution of container workloads through the use of live migration.

This approach has a significant impact on business growth and project performance. However, its implementation is challenging. Therefore, a systematic literature review (SLR) is used to reveal the challenges faced in Agile project execution. The Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) knowledge areas were adopted to classify the challenges. A total of 23 papers from 400 were identified as the result of SLR extraction. The challenges from related studies were categorized into the PMBOK knowledge areas. A mapping from the challenges to the solutions was performed using the PMBOK Guide, Prince2 Agile, Agile Practice Guide, and other related references. This study provides a list of Agile challenges and their mapped solutions. The biggest challenge arises from stakeholder management, which includes challenges related to Agile adaption, Agile transition, and Agile transformation. Other challenges include project resource management, project integration management, project scope management, and project schedule management.

The aim of the current study is to examine the influence of big data (BD) on the performance of service organizations and to probe for a deeper understanding of implementing BD, based on available technologies. Design/methodology/approach: An ethnographic study was conducted following an abductive approach. A primary qualitative research scheme was used with 35 information technology and database professionals participating in five online focus groups of seven participants each. Analytical themes were developed simultaneously with the literature being revisited throughout the study to ultimately create sets of common themes and dimensions. Findings: BD can help organizations build agility, especially within dynamic industries, to better predict customer behavioral patterns and make tailor-made propositions from the BD. An integrated BD-specific framework is proposed to address value according to the dimensions of need, value, time and utility. Research limitations/implications: Little research exists on the key drivers of BD use for dynamic, real-time and agile businesses. This research adds to the developing literature on BD applications to support organizational decision-making and business performance in the tourism industry. Originality/value: This study responds to scholars’ recent calls for more empirical research with contextual understanding of the use of BD to add value in marketing intelligence within business ecosystems. It delineates factors contributing to BD value creation and explores the impacts on the respective service encounters. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","BD-specific framework; Big data; IT experts; Online focus groups; Tourism organizations",,"Stylos, N.; School of Management, Taiwan; email: n.stylos@bristol.ac.uk",,"Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.",09596119,,,,"English","Int.

With current developments in the field of e.g. artificial intelligence and machine learning, big data and data analytics, cloud computing, conversational systems and adaptive architectures, robotics as well as virtual and augmented reality work life is facing huge challenges. On the other side the networking over the internet, more effective handling and sharing of data and new forms of human-machine-collaboration offer a great variety of potentials for designing even more flexible business processes, agile working structures and even smarter working setups and environments. Technique, organizational aspects and humans in the future are going to be within a new triad. Instead of taking the role of a “dominator” or “captain” as in former times, humans now more and more have to fulfill tasks as a “conductor”. The role of building up and interacting within new hybrid networks and holistic systems is gaining higher importance – leading to massive changes with reference to all dimensions of work. Total new requirements concerning work objectives, working tasks, work equipment, workspace as well as new challenges for organization, qualification, employment and leadership arise.

At the same time, big data and artificial intelligence, question the traditional tools of the human designer. Morphogenetic (concerned with the beginning of the form of an object) prototyping provides a method for designers to control this complexity by separating the design into pseudo developmental stages to enable the manipulation of its development at different stages. This paper investigates the tools, processes, theory and systems that would be needed to simulate this design experience. Through this process a katana sword is selected as the metaphor for the design experience to relate the affordance of cutting to the simulation of a pseudo biological sub division. A sword prototype is used to identify appropriate gestures to map to biological behaviours in order to trigger the simulation of staged pseudo biological processes in the design model. Finally, the tangible user interface (TUI) tool based on the katana sword is refined and future work is outlined. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.","Agile biomimetics; Design experience; Morphogenetic prototyping; Narrative prototyping; Tangible user interface","Big data; Bioinformatics; Biomimetics; User interfaces; Biological process; Computation power; Design experience; Design modeling; Design softwares; Developmental stage; Different stages; Tangible user interfaces; Design","McGinley, T.; University of South AustraliaAustralia; email: tim.mcginley@unisa.edu.au","Wardaszko M.Meijer S.Leigh E.Naweed A.","Springer Verlag",03029743,9783319787947,,,"English","Lect.

Specifically this paper covers the development of a generalizable rig state engine based on the application of supervised machine learning. The same steps used in the creation of the production rig state engine are appled here to a smaller data set to demonstrate both the tractability of the problem and the methods used to create the rig state engine in the production system. The project objective was to provide efficiency and engineering metrics in a central repository covering operated regions. The system is designed to require minimal user configuration and management and provides both historic and near real time analysis to deliver a rich resource for offset comparison and benchmarking. Identifying rig-state is at the heart of every performance and engineering analysis system. This can be thought of as a machine learning classification problem. A large supervised learning set was constructed and used to train classification models which were compared for accuracy. A key success metric was the ability to generalise the selected model across different operations. Output from the rig-state classifier was then used to derive KPI data which was presented through a web based front end. A pilot system was then developed using agile principles allowing for rapid user engagement. Testing demonstrated that the system can support all real time operations within the company simultaneously and rapidly process historic well data for offset benchmarking. The cloud-based architecture allows rapid deployment of the system to new groups significantly reducing deployment costs. The system provides a foundation for onward data science and more advanced functionality. Minimal configuration, cloud storage and processing, combining contextual data with real-time rig data, near-real-time and historic analysis capabilities, rapid deployment, low cost, high accuracy and consistent metrics are all key and proven value drivers for the system. The output data is aso a valuable resource for additional machine learning and data science projects.

In this way, firms and ecosystems that have successfully understood the importance of these variables found will be able to better answer to changes becoming more agile. Successful big data integration, accessibility and standard business rules, as we identify as the main roadblocks, will allow firms in data-driven sectors, and in particular in computer vision-based data set, to be efficient in the interconnection and to become more agile. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Data ecosystem; Data value chain; Digital transformation",,"Ceci, F.; Department of Business Administration, Italy; email: federica.ceci@unich.it","Za S.Winter R.Lazazzara A.","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH",21954968,9783031157691,,,"English","Lect.

Prediction of the shop floor activities has a great potential to reduce manufacturing costs, by providing the information required for operational decisions like preventive maintenance, automatic remediation or scheduling optimization. Research has been focusing on how machine learning algorithms can be used to better understand and extract insights from historical data collected from manufacturing systems. However, in the current manufacturing environments, driven by mass customization and short time to market, these approaches fail to be agile enough to be useful. In this paper we propose a real-time machine learning approach for large scale manufacturing systems that can predict various scenarios before service degradation occurs, thus allowing for corrective actions. At the same time, outliner detection algorithms can be used to evaluate the system’s health at a holistic level. Scalability requirements are achieved by modelling the architecture around data streams processed in real time by map-reduce operations.

I4.0 uses innovative trends such as Big Data, Cloud Computing, and Internet of things (IOT) to maximize economic benefits and return on investments. However, developing an I4.0 project may be costly, complex and risky for some companies. Therefore, careful requirements definition and mature Requirement Engineering (RE) processes are necessary. Undeveloped RE processes and poorly defined business requirements will often result in an inferior or a cancelled project. In addition, to ensure agility and allow for iterative changes in developing projects for I4.0, agile methodologies should be applied and prudently assessed. Unfortunately, most of existing assessment models are narrow focused and lack theoretical foundation and proper validation. This research proposes a comprehensive maturity framework called agile Requirement Engineering Maturity Model for Industry 4.0 (ARE-MMI4.0). The framework provides assessment of the minimum maturity levels to start a project for I4.0. The framework integrates an I4.0 maturity model with RE and agile maturity models to ensure the ultimate maturity assessment for the business processes. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Agile; Industry 4.0; Maturity models integration; Requirements engineering","Economics; Industry 4.0; Information systems; Information use; Iterative methods; Requirements engineering; Agile; Business requirement; Internet of Things (IOT); Maturity assessments; Maturity model; Requirement engineering; Requirements definition; Theoretical foundations; Agile manufacturing systems","Elnagar, S.; Virginia Commonwealth University, United States; email: elnagarsa@vcu.edu","Themistocleous M.Themistocleous M.da Cunha P.R.","Springer Verlag",18651348,9783030113940,,,"English","Lect.

The competition has expanded between the supply chain management perspectives of two firms. In order to sustain within the current competitive environment supply chain professionals of a firm are struggling hard to handle large-scale data, that is important to reach an integrated, efficient, effective as well as agile supply chain process within their business. As a result, explosive growth of data volume and amount of data within business, made it mandatory for the supply chain processionals to use an effective data analytic tool in order to manage these data. The main aim of this study is to identify use of various data analytic tools in order to manage large data of supply process and inventory management process with several advantages and disadvantages. As per the literature findings, it has been observed that use of data analytic tools within an organisation can be helpful to investigate new insights of the supply chain process, which can be able to detect different parts and elements of that process. A mixed method approach has been incorporated within this research paper by collecting primary and secondary both data collection process. Total 50 employees engaged with inventory and supply chain management of different firm are chosen to conduct a survey. Secondary data are collected from secondary sources. As per the findings, it can be stated that big data analytics plays a positive role in organization for managing large data. © 2022 IEEE.","challenges; Cloud-computing; Data processing.

These changes are driven by the increased penetration of distributed Low Carbon Technologies, both on the generation side (i.e. adoption of micro-renewables) and demand side (i.e. electric vehicle charging). The previously passive ‘fit-and-forget’ approach to LV network management is becoming increasing inefficient to ensure its effective operation. A more agile approach to operation and planning is needed, that includes pro-active prediction and mitigation of risks to local sub-networks (such as risk of voltage deviations out of legal limits). The mass rollout of smart meters (SMs) and advances in metering infrastructure holds the promise for smarter network management. However, many of the proposed methods require full observability, yet the expectation of being able to collect complete, error free data from every smart meter is unrealistic in operational reality. Furthermore, the smart meter (SM) roll-out has encountered significant issues, with the current voluntary nature of installation in the UK and in many other countries resulting in low-likelihood of full SM coverage for all LV networks. Even with a comprehensive SM roll-out privacy restrictions, constrain data availability from meters. To address these issues, this paper proposes the use of a Deep Learning Neural Network architecture to predict the voltage distribution with partial SM coverage on actual network operator LV circuits. The results show that SM measurements from key locations are sufficient for effective prediction of the voltage distribution, even without the use of the high granularity personal power demand data from individual customers. © 2021 The Author(s)","Analytic methods in power networks; Big Data Analytics; Deep neural learning; Distribution network operation; Privacy-preserving data analysis; Smart meters; Voltage prediction","Big data; Deep neural networks; Electric power transmission networks; Forecasting; Network architecture; Privacy-preserving techniques; Smart meters; Smart power grids; Analytic method; Analytic method in power network; Big data analytic; Data analytics; Deep neural learning; Distribution network operation; Neural learning; Power networks; Privacy preserving; Privacy-preserving data analyse; Voltage prediction; Data Analytics","Mokhtar, M.; School of Engineering and Physical Sciences, Earl Mountbatten Building EM. 3.31, Gait 2, Heriot-Watt University, United Kingdom; email: m.mokhtar@hw.ac.uk",,"Elsevier B.V.",26665468,,,,"English","Energy.

However, the traditional evaluating models mostly consider the historical performance data and fail to predict and diagnose the problems' root. This paper proposes a distributed, trustworthy, tamper-proof, and learning framework for evaluating service supply chain performance based on blockchain and adaptive network-based fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS) techniques, named Di-ANFIS. The main objectives of this research are as follows: (1) presenting hierarchical criteria of service supply chain performance to cope with the diagnosis of the problems' root; (2) proposing a smart learning model to deal with the uncertainty conditions by a combination of neural network and fuzzy logic; and (3) introducing a distributed blockchain-based framework due to the dependence of ANFIS on big data and the lack of trust and security in the supply chain. Furthermore, the proposed six-layer conceptual framework consists of the data layer, connection layer, blockchain layer, smart layer, ANFIS layer, and application layer. This architecture creates a performance management system using the Internet of Things, smart contracts, and ANFIS based on the blockchain platform. The Di-ANFIS model provides a performance evaluation system without needing a third party and a reliable intermediary that provides an agile and diagnostic model in a smart and learning process. It also saves computing time and speeds up information flow. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

To increase system utilization, cluster operators often configure their clusters such that multiple co-located applications can simultaneously share the resources of a cluster node. With resource sharing, applications can compete with each other for shared node resources thereby interfering with each other's performance. Many Spark applications take a long time to execute. Performance interference from other applications can thus cause a Spark application to fail or take even longer time to execute thereby wasting cluster resources and frustrating users. This motivates the need for an automated technique that can detect interference quickly and also diagnose the root cause of the interference to facilitate mitigation of the problem. Most existing approaches are not designed to offer quick interference detection and diagnosis. For example, they typically require extensive training data for every application of interest under various possible input data sizes and resource allocations. In this paper, we systematically investigate the design of a Machine Learning (ML) based technique that addresses this open problem. We implement a tool called Diaspore that integrates our findings. We evaluate the tool with a diverse set of 13 Spark applications executing on a real cluster. Experimental results show that Diaspore requires only small scale training data, i.e., executions under small input sizes and resource allocations. Furthermore, our results show that the tool can offer accurate predictions for applications not present in the training data. Consequently, Diaspore reduces the training time needed to offer predictions. Finally, the feature engineering underlying Diaspore ensures that the tool can detect and diagnose interference quickly in an online manner by sampling only a small fraction of a long running application's execution. This can allow cluster operators to mitigate interference in an agile manner. © 2013 IEEE.","big data; Interference detection; machine learning","Refractory materials; Resource allocation; Turing machines; Accurate prediction; Automated techniques; Big data applications; Computing platform; Feature engineerings; Interference detection; Long-running applications; System utilization; Cluster computing","Amannejad, Y.; Mathematics and Computing Department, Canada; email: yamannejad@mtroyal.ca",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",21693536,,,,"English","IEEE Access",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111066601

A large number of manufacturing resources are designed and developed with virtual (digital) ones, which will be associated with the physical ones throughout their lifecycle. With the recent emergence of information and communications technologies (ICTs), such as internet of things, big data, virtual reality, artificial intelligence, and 5G, the interconnection and interaction between physical resources and virtual ones become possible in production systems. Digital twin (DT) shows great potential to realize the cyber-physical production system (CPPS) in the era of Industry 4.0. In this paper, we present our vision on integrating various physical resources into CPPS via DT and AutomationML. To elaborate on how to apply ICTs, this paper firstly explores a generic architecture of CPPS based on DT. DT is a virtual and authoritative representation of physical manufacturing resource, since DT includes various models and manufacturing big data of resource. The proposed architecture is illustrated in detail as follows: (1) physical layer, (2) network layer, (3) virtual layer, and (4) application layer. A case of expert fault diagnose for aircraft engine is presented using the proposed information fusion in the architecture. Secondly, this paper proposes an approach of information modeling for CPPS based on AutomationML. Various manufacturing services can be encapsulated and defined in the standardized format (AutomationML), and then the corresponding virtual manufacturing resources (DTs) will be integrated into CPPS. Finally, this paper describes a case of information modeling for blisk machining and demonstrates the modeling approach in real-life scenarios for support manufacturing resource sharing via DT.

Software Defined Network (SDN) Technology has increasingly become essential in many advanced computer networks, including those in modern CPS, to provide flexible and agile network development. Despite many benefits that SDN offers, malicious attacks that can eventually prevent network services are unavoidable. Among the most predominant attacks on SDN controller layer, Link Discovery Attack and ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) Spoofing Attack are fundamental in that they are the gateways of many other SDN threats and attacks. To defend these attacks, most existing techniques either rely on relatively complex data validation techniques or use thresholds that can be subjective and unable to detect more than one type of attacks at a time if one deciding factor is used. While Big data technology, particularly machine learning, has been widely used for intrusion/anomaly detection, little has been done in SDN. This paper explores how well this technology can be used to predict these SDN attacks. By employing typical machine learning algorithms on simulated data of routing in SDN when attacks occur, preliminary results, obtained from four machine learning models, show the average area under ROC curve of over 96% and 92% for sample size 50,970 (12 switches) and 60,000 (20 switches), respectively. Further experiments show near-linear scaling in training time for the best performing algorithm when sample size grows up to 100,000. © 2018 IEEE.","ARP Spoofing attack; Data Analytic Applications; Link Discovery attack; Machine Learning; SDN-specific security; Software-Defined Networking","Application programs; Big data; Embedded systems; Internet protocols; Intrusion detection; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Network security; Software defined networking; Address Resolution Protocol; Area under roc curve (AUC); ARP Spoofing; Cyber-physical systems (CPS); Link Discovery; Machine learning models; Monitoring and control; SDN-specific security; Machine learning",,"Song Y.Liu B.Lee K.Abe N.Pu C.Qiao M.Ahmed N.Kossmann D.Saltz J.Tang J.He J.Liu H.Hu X.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781538650356,,,"English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

By selecting an appropriate window function in the frequency-domain, the impulse responses can be all identical while achieving marked sidelobe level improvement. Furthermore, we analyse the echoes of targets with different speeds and point out the situation which would happen in modern radar application.

In discussing such trends, existing research has either focussed on the skills marketers need or broad-based approaches such as agile methods but has given less consideration to just how such skills or approaches might be developed and used in marketers' day-to-day activities and in the organisation of marketing in the firm. This is what the authors address in this paper. Design/methodology/approach: This paper adopts an in-depth case study approach to examine an exemplary digital enterprise in transformation of their digital marketing. The insights were gathered from 25 interviews, netnography and document analysis of the case organisation in addition to 10 interviews with independent experts. Findings: Drawing on practice-oriented approach, the authors show how organisations respond to the emerging trends of digital consumers and big data by taking a ‘hacking marketing’ approach and developing novel marketing expertise at disciplinary boundaries. The authors put forward three sets of practices that enable and shape the hacking marketing approach. These include spanning the expertise boundary, making value measurable and experimenting through which their adaptive, iterative and multidisciplinary work occurs. This explains how managing digital consumers and big data is not within the realm of information technology (IT) functions but marketing and how marketing professionals are changing their practice and moving their disciplinary boundaries. Practical implications: This study offers practical contributions for firms in terms of identifying new work practices and expertise that marketing specialists need in managing digital platforms, digitalised consumers and big data. This study’s results show that enterprises need to design and implement strong training programmes to prepare their marketing workforce in adopting experimentations of agile approach and data-driven decision making. In addition, Marketing education should be changed so that programmes consider a review of their courses and include the novel marketing models and approaches into their curriculum. Originality/value: This study contributes to the nascent discussions by unpacking how enterprises can develop new marketing expertise and practices beyond skillsets and how such practices form new hacking marketing approach which addresses the problem of the inability of the conventional marketing approach to show its value within the firm. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Digital marketing; Digital organisation; Digitalised consumers; Expertise; Hacking; Occupations; Practice",,"Hafezieh, N.; School of Business and Management, United Kingdom; email: Najmeh.Hafezieh@rhul.ac.uk",,"Emerald Publishing",17410398,,,,"English","J.

For the EOSs with optical sensors particularly, the observation mission is significantly influenced by the uncertainty of cloud coverage, which has been identified as the most dominant factor for the invalidation of remote sensing images. To overcome this uncertainty, uncertainty programming methods, namely, chance constraint programming (CCP), stochastic expectation model, and robust optimization, are put forth. Despite their success, these approaches are limited in that they simplified the complex cloud coverage uncertainty, which may be different from the true cloud conditions, and they did not take the true cloud information into consideration. Motivated by these recent trends toward Big Data of satellite cloud images and machine learning for spatiotemporal prediction, this article explores a dynamic replanning scheme for multiple EOSs based on cloud forecasting. Specifically, we propose a new approach mainly in the following three steps: first, proactive scheduling based on a CCP is implemented and uploaded via ground control; second, cloud forecasting can be continuously conducted relying on the predictive recurrent neural network and the latest satellite cloud image; and third, mission replanning can be conducted according to the initial schedule and relatively accurate cloud information. Simulation results show that the cloud forecasting method is effective, and the replanning approach presents highly efficient and accurate scheduling results. © 2008-2012 IEEE.","Agile Earth observation satellite (AEOS); artificial neural network; cloud forecasting; mission replanning; uncertainty programming","Big data; Computer programming; Constraint theory; Observatories; Optimization; Planning; Production control; Recurrent neural networks; Remote sensing; Rock mechanics; Satellites; Scheduling; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Agile earth observation satellite; Chance constraint programming; Cloud coverage; Cloud forecasting; Earth observation satellites; Earth observing systems; Mission re-planning; Re-planning; Uncertainty; Uncertainty programming; Forecasting; artificial neural network; EOS; forecasting method; satellite data; satellite imagery; spatiotemporal analysis; uncertainty analysis",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",19391404,,,,"English","IEEE J.

Unfortunately, the tools and methods necessary to rapidly collect, aggregate, and analyze this information have not evolved as a whole in conjunction with this increased system complexity and, therefore, has made analysis and evaluation increasingly deficient and ineffective. The Test Resource Management Center's (TRMC's) vision is to build a DoD test and evaluation (TE) knowledge management (KM) and analysis capability that leverages commercial big data analysis and cloud computing technologies to improve evaluation quality and reduce decision-making time. An evaluation revolution, starting with the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) program, is underway to ensure the TE community can support the demands of next-generation weapon systems.The true product of TE is knowledge ascertained through the collection of information about a system or item under test. However, the TE community's ability to provide this knowledge is hampered by more complex systems, more complex environments, and the need to be more agile in support of strategic initiatives, such as agile acquisition and the 3rd Offset Strategy. This increased complexity and need for speed cause delayed analysis and problems that go undetected during TE. The primary reason for these shortfalls is antiquated tools and processes that make data hard to locate, aggregate, and convert into knowledge. In short, DoD has not evolved its evaluation infrastructure as its weapon systems have evolved.Conversely, commercial entities, such as medical observation and diagnosis, electric power distribution, retail, and industrial manufacturing, have embraced agility in their methodologies while modernizing analytics capabilities to keep up with the massive influx of data. Raw physical sensors could provide data, higher-quality image or video cameras, radio frequency identification (RFID) devices, faster data collectors, more detailed point-of-sale information or digitized records, and ultimately is providing more data to analysts in size and complexity than ever before. As more data has become available, an interrelated phenomenon is the desire of analysts to ask more detailed questions about their consumers and their business infrastructure. To drive the process of implementing big data analytics, businesses have begun establishing analytics centers which either take pre-defined business cases and apply methods to address them or implement existing knowledge within the data architecture to create a higher level of awareness to business groups or the company at-large. To meet these demands, data storage and computation architectures have become more sophisticated, dozens of technologies were developed for large-scale processing (such as Apache Hadoop or GreenPlum), and streaming architectures which allow data to be processed and actioned on in real-time as it is collected have become commonplace. The net result of these commercial best practices is a solid foundation for the DoD to transform how it uses data to achieve faster, better, and smarter decisions throughout the acquisition lifecycle. © 2018 IEEE.","Big Data; Cloud Computing; Data Analytics; Data Management; Department of Defense; Knowledge Management; Predictive Maintainance; Test and Evaluation; Virtualization","Aggregates; Agile manufacturing systems; Big data; Cloud computing; Data Analytics; Decision making; Diagnosis; Electric power distribution; Electronic warfare; Fighter aircraft; Information management; Knowledge management; Predictive analytics; Quality control; Radio frequency identification (RFID); Software testing; Systems engineering; Video cameras; Virtualization; Analysis and evaluation; Cloud computing technologies; Department of Defense; Industrial manufacturing; Joint strike fighter programs; Next-generation weapons; Predictive Maintainance; Test and evaluation; Digital storage",,"Song Y.Liu B.Lee K.Abe N.Pu C.Qiao M.Ahmed N.Kossmann D.Saltz J.Tang J.He J.Liu H.Hu X.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781538650356,,,"English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

Contact tracing is a vital strategy in epidemic emergency management; however, traditional contact tracing faces many limitations in practice. The application of digital technology provides an opportunity for local governments to trace the contacts of individuals with COVID-19 more comprehensively, efficiently, and precisely. Objective: Our research aimed to provide new solutions to overcome the limitations of traditional contact tracing by introducing the organizational process, technical process, and main achievements of digital contact tracing in Hainan Province. Methods: A graph database algorithm, which can efficiently process complex relational networks, was applied in Hainan Province; this algorithm relies on a governmental big data platform to analyze multisource COVID-19 epidemic data and build networks of relationships among high-risk infected individuals, the general population, vehicles, and public places to identify and trace contacts. We summarized the organizational and technical process of digital contact tracing in Hainan Province based on interviews and data analyses. Results: An integrated emergency management command system and a multi-agency coordination mechanism were formed during the emergency management of the COVID-19 epidemic in Hainan Province. The collection, storage, analysis, and application of multisource epidemic data were realized based on the government’s big data platform using a centralized model. The graph database algorithm is compatible with this platform and can analyze multisource and heterogeneous big data related to the epidemic. These practices were used to quickly and accurately identify and trace 10,871 contacts among hundreds of thousands of epidemic data records; 378 closest contacts and a number of public places with high risk of infection were identified. A confirmed patient was found after quarantine measures were implemented by all contacts. Conclusions: During the emergency management of the COVID-19 epidemic, Hainan Province used a graph database algorithm to trace contacts in a centralized model, which can identify infected individuals and high-risk public places more quickly and accurately. This practice can provide support to government agencies to implement precise, agile, and evidence-based emergency management measures and improve the responsiveness of the public health emergency response system. Strengthening data security, improving tracing accuracy, enabling intelligent data collection, and improving data-sharing mechanisms and technologies are directions for optimizing digital contact tracing. © Zijun Mao, Hong Yao, Qi Zou, Weiting Zhang, Ying Dong.","Big data; China; COVID-19; Digital contact tracing; Emergency management; Graph database; Visualization","algorithm; China; computer graphics; contact examination; epidemic; epidemiology; factual database; human; prevention and control; procedures; Algorithms; Big Data; China; Computer Graphics; Contact Tracing; COVID-19; Data Visualization; Databases, Factual; Digital Technology; Epidemics; Humans","Mao, Z.; College of Public Administration, 1037 Luoyu Road, China; email: maozijun@hust.edu.cn",,"JMIR Publications Inc.",22915222,,,"33460389","English","JMIR mHealth uHealth",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100358068

In this paper, we will be reviewing some of the anticipated regulatory issues in commercial implementations of carbon capture & sequestration (CCS) and discuss how machine learning and big data analytics can diminish future non-compliance incidents. With the rising awareness of advanced data-driven technologies such as ""Big Data Analytics"" and ""Machine Learning"", a contemporary approach to regulation and compliance is developing. This emerging approach, called ""Algorithmic Regulation"", defines an alternative framework for systematic collection of data (real-time or near real-time) and continuous generation of knowledge through intelligent computational algorithms in order to regulate a domain of activities. In this study, we will look at some of the major data management challenges in the pilot CCS operations with regards to rules and regulations. We will then discuss how an algorithmic regulatory framework can help in conducting CCS operations in a manner that are compliant with environmental, safety and health policies and regulations. Field operators collect a lot of data which needs to be formatted and modelled in a fashion acceptable to understand the operator's compliance with regulation. Generally, such compliance qualification criteria are verified using human intellect and basic querying software. In other industries, the idea of converting rules & regulations in a format understandable by machines is gaining momentum and great strides have been taken. The technological progresses made possible by data-driven analytical techniques can create a paradigm shift in the way rules and regulations are designed and implemented. Large-scale deployment of CCS projects is bound to bring with it a number of regulatory issues, making it a necessity to proactively explore and address the anticipated issues. These technologies can equip regulated entities as well as regulators with advanced tools for managing complexity in CCS projects. These improved solutions will help companies to better meet the regulatory data collection, reporting and governance requirements in large scale CCS operations. This paper looks into advanced data management and modeling techniques like ""algorithmic regulations"" to increase compliance in carbon capture and sequestration projects. The concept of handling rules and regulations in the form of big data will change the outlook and compliance management will become increasingly more agile and responsive. © 2019, Society of Petroleum Engineers","Artificial Intelligence; Carbon Capture; Machine Learning; Regulations & Policy; Sequestration",,,,"Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE)",,,,,"English","SPE West.

Queries must be run on an index, with any parameters of the retrieval models suitably tuned. With the advent of learning-to-rank, such experimental processes (including the appropriate folding of queries to achieve cross-fold validation) have resulted in complicated experimental designs and hence scripting. At the same time, machine learning platforms such as Scikit Learn and Apache Spark have pioneered the notion of an experimental pipeline , which naturally allows a supervised classification experiment to be expressed a series of stages, which can be learned or transformed. In this demonstration, we detail Terrier-Spark, a recent adaptation to the Terrier Information Retrieval platform which permits it to be used within the experimental pipelines of Spark. We argue that this (1) provides an agile experimental platform for information retrieval, comparable to that enjoyed by other branches of data science; (2) aids research reproducibility in information retrieval by facilitating easily-distributable notebooks containing conducted experiments; and (3) facilitates the teaching of information retrieval experiments in educational environments. © 2018 Author.","Apache spark; Jupyter notebooks; Terrier ir platform","Pipelines; Supervised learning; Educational environment; Experimental platform; Jupyter notebooks; Learning to rank; Reproducibilities; Supervised classification; Terrier information retrieval platforms; Terrier ir platform; Information retrieval","Macdonald, C.; University of GlasgowUnited Kingdom; email: craig.macdonald@glasgow.ac.uk",,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc",,9781450356572,,,"English","Int.

For example, research on the performance of buildings may require data from multiple sources that lack a singular standard for data reporting. The Building Management System might report data at regular 5minute intervals, whereas an air-quality sensor might capture values only when there has been significant change from the previous value. Many systems exist to help integrate multiple data sources into a single system or interface. However, such systems do not necessarily make it easy to modify an integration plan, for example, to accommodate data exploration, new and changing data sets or shifts in the questions of interest. We propose an agile data-integration system to enable quick and adaptive analysis across many data sets, concentrating initially on the data alignment step: combining data values from multiple time-series based data sets whose time schedules. To this end, we adopt a Domain Specific Language approach where we construct a domain model for alignment, provide a specification language for describing alignments in the model and implement an interpreter for specification in that language. Our implementation exploits a rank-based join in SQL that produces faster alignment times than the commonly suggested method of aligning data sets in a database. We present experiments to demonstrate the advantage of our method and exploit data properties for optimization. © 2020 IEEE.","data alignment; data integration; time series","Agile manufacturing systems; Air quality; Alignment; Data integration; Data Science; Information use; Intelligent buildings; Problem oriented languages; Specification languages; Specifications; Time series analysis; Agile integration; Building management system; Data integration system; Domain-specific language approaches; Multiple data sources; Multiple time series; Performance of buildings; Scientific researches; Information management",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781728110547,,,"English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

The monitoring and reporting falls into three main categories-periodic system monitoring, on-event log file monitoring, and closed loop end-to-end data flow monitoring, which is used not only for near-real time monitoring but also as a basis for operational performance reporting of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). This system has grown over the past 15 years from processing less than a thousand log file entries per day up to a projected 80 million entries with the advent of upcoming Satellite Programmes-EUMETSAT Polar System (EPS) Second Generation, Jason-CS/Sentinel-6 and Meteosat Third Generation. The combined amount of data from these programmes falls into the big data category and agile solutions must be found in order to provide sufficient processing, storage, and retrieval capability. This paper explores the challenges and potential solutions of preparing for big data in the mission performance monitoring systems, including the software and technology stacks used, methods such as pre-processing data to allow quick access to KPIs, and an scalable infrastructure allowing for easy migration to more performant hardware through the use of virtualized environments. In recent years the technology stack as well as the architectural design for the proprietary monitoring and reporting tools have been evolved in readiness for big data. Storage of data is now performed using a Relational Database Management System, with a Java processing layer contained within a web server. The default method of event persistence is now based on Message Queue (MQ) technology, however other methods of persistence are available such as HTTP RESTful and legacy FTP to ensure compatibility. One major consideration for a big data system is the ability to aggregate data in order to report on KPIs. In order to facilitate this, reporting data is pre-processed and aggregated on a daily basis, meaning the underlying data does not need to be accessed for common reports. For ad-hoc style reporting, there is an option to run reports as a background task with a notification to the user upon completion. The reporting made available to the users through an intuitive web interface, including options to subscribe to report delivery via email. In terms of hardware, the platform used to support the mission performance monitoring has been upgraded as a matter of obsolescence replacement to a virtualized environment based on Hypervisors. While this current generation of hardware is only sufficient for the current missions, moving to a virtualized environment ensures that migration to more performance hardware can be performed easily and in a way that is largely transparent to the users. While scalability on the hardware level is therefore ensured, and the current software design and technology stack fulfils the current requirements and projected data sizing, there are still concerns regarding software performance in accessing such large amounts of information. Therefore alternative COTS solutions for the proprietary software are also being considered with a potential for hybrid solutions based on proven and reliable technologies. In addition, it is intended to re-analyse the overall approach for mission performance monitoring and reporting along with an industry and best-practice study to understand the most efficient and effective methods of meeting user needs for mission performance monitoring and reporting. © 2018, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

Firstly, the mathematical expression of agile supply chain network and its agility measurement method are defined, and the constraints of complex network theory are also defined. Secondly, to facilitate the calculation of agility metrics, complex network theory is introduced into agile supply chain network. In addition, a large number of experiments have been designed and implemented to verify the accuracy of the proposed complex network theory in agile supply chain network measurement. At the same time, the agility of the supply chain network is measured, and its changing rules and optimization methods are summarized.

Moreover, designing visualization courses by matching the different experiences and skills of the students is a major goal in order to find a common solvable task for all of them. Particularly, the given task is important to follow a common project goal, to collaborate in small project groups, but also to further experience, learn, or extend programming skills. In this article, we survey our experiences from teaching 116 student project groups of 6 bachelor courses on information visualization with varying topics. Moreover, two teaching strategies were tried: 2 courses were held without lectures and assignments but with weekly scrum sessions (further denoted by TS1) and 4 courses were guided by weekly lectures and assignments (further denoted by TS2). A total number of 687 students took part in all of these 6 courses. Managing the ever growing number of students in computer and data science is a big challenge in these days, i.e., the students typically apply a design-based active learning scenario while being supported by weekly lectures, assignments, or scrum sessions. As a major outcome, we identified a regular supervision either by lectures and assignments or by regular scrum sessions as important due to the fact that the students were relatively unexperienced bachelor students with a wide range of programming skills, but nearly no visualization background. In this article, we explain different subsequent stages to successfully handle the upcoming problems and describe how much supervision was involved in the development of the visualization project. The project task description is given in a way that it has a minimal number of requirements but can be extended in many directions while most of the decisions are up to the students like programming languages, visualization approaches, or interaction techniques. Finally, we discuss the benefits and drawbacks of both teaching strategies.

A successful aftermarket data system goes beyond the basics of supplying reliability figures. Its attributes also include additional metrics for an effective alerting and reporting system to enable proactive response to aftermarket issues. While these system features are key, the implementation and maintenance methodology of the system is crucial to its success. This is because these systems involve big data. In the case presented, it is data which spans several years, for a variety of model numbers on a variety of aircraft platforms or applications. Each set of circumstances yields different reliability figures and associated metrics. With this big data, it is equally crucial to its success to have a methodology to address data integrity, the speed of data, and the portability of data. Our solution with this successful methodology of these features is called Structured Data.A good aftermarket data system is a backbone for any successful organization. A good system in the aerospace industry goes beyond ATA Spec 2000 [1] formatted data and standard reliability figures such as MTBUR (Mean Time Between Unscheduled Removal) and MTBF (Mean Time Between Failure). It is also beyond implementing a Failure Reporting and Corrective Action System (FRACAS). A comprehensive system in the aerospace industry includes several additional measures (i.e. frequency, severity, risk) to represent the Voice of the Customer. And with a built-in mechanism for proactive response to the data, the system can then be considered World-Class.While designing a system with these features is important, its success also hinges upon the methodology of implementation and maintenance. As stated earlier, aftermarket data is considered big data due to the volume of highly specific data. With this big data, it is critical to success to address data integrity, the speed of data, and the portability of data all within a user-friendly experience. For data integrity, do we trust the data? This takes on many forms from cross referencing input and output data to determining an accurate mixed fleet factor. For speed of data, do we have a system in place to handle the cadence of data efficiently? For portability, do we structure our data in such a way where we can be agile to serve potential changes to our system or new systems as our company evolves? For a user-friendly experience, can we structure the data for intuitive analysis for all stakeholders? Thus in the proposed system, all of these aspects of data integrity, the speed of data, the portability of data, and formatting the data per stakeholders are addressed. Our solution with this successful methodology of these features is called Structured Data.The benefits of this newly developed Structured Data extend beyond ATA Spec 2000 in which it is based. The data is structured in a dynamic and interactive environment. This environment includes intuitive analysis and a system of prioritization for corrective action. The key benefit of this Structured Data system is proactive response to aftermarket data analysis. © 2021 IEEE.","Big data; Data integrity Speed of data; FRACAS; MTBUR / MTBF; Natural Language Programming (NLP); Portability of data; Product performance; Reliability metrics; Voice of Customer","Aerospace industry; Big data; Natural language processing systems; Risk assessment; Speed; Corrective action systems; Data integrity; Data integrity speed of data; Failure reporting and corrective action system; Mean time between failures; Mean time between unscheduled removal / mean time between failure; Natural language programming; Natural languages; Portability of data; Product performance; Reliability metrics; Voices of customers",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",0149144X,9781728180175,,,"English","Proc.

To remain competitive, companies must integrate innovative capabilities like ‘industry-4.0 technologies’ with their operation and supply chain (SC) strategies. The integration of various strategies has been investigated with the associated effect on performance; however, studies on how industry 4.0 technologies might support integrated strategies are still incipient. This work investigates the hierarchical relationships of ‘industry 4.0 technologies’ with lean and agile strategies. Adopting the ‘Interpretive Structural Modelling (ISM)’ technique to present a model depicting the linkage, the work also classifies the technologies and practices according to their ‘driving’ and ‘dependency’ powers. The findings revealed that the technologies have a high affinity to enable the implementation of lean and agile strategies. Among the nine technologies included in the study, ‘Cyber-Physical-System’, ‘Internet-of-Things’, ‘Cloud-Computing’, and ‘Big-Data-Analytics’ have the highest driving powers, signifying their higher affinity with the practices. Meanwhile, all the practices have a high enough affinity to be influenced by the technologies, except for a few (3/16 of lean and 2/9 of agile) that possess affinities too low to be driven by these technologies.

Internet of Things (IoT) sensor data are generated through smart applications and stored in databases. Time series databases require huge storage spaces, as over time they consume a large amount of memory. In this paper, we propose an enhanced compression algorithm for time series data generated by IoT systems that monitor the production of electrical energy by solar panels. The best way to ensure that solar energy systems have high efficiency is to continuously monitor all electrical and environmental factors. However, this requires the collection of enormous quantities of data that can be used to detect defects in the generation of electric energy or in solar panels. As the data must be available for analysis, a lossless compression algorithm is needed. In addition, the compressed data must be in a format that can be queried to perform analysis operations dependent on speed; this means that the decompression of data should not be time-consuming. Our results showed the high speed of the compression process along with good compression rate (16.6%) after applying the proposed compression algorithm. © MYU K.K.","compressed time series data; lossless compression algorithm; solar energy; wireless sensor network","Big data; Data compression; Digital storage; Energy harvesting; Internet of things; Solar concentrators; Solar panels; Time series; Wireless sensor networks; Compressed time series data; Compression algorithms; Lossless compression algorithm; Sensors data; Smart applications; Solar energy harvesting; Solar panels; Storage spaces; Time Series Database; Time-series data; Solar energy","El-Hageen, H.M.; Electrical Engineering Department, P.O.

As a result, we can witness an increasing amount of government open data shared on public government's portals that become sources of rich big data. While this scenario provides data transparency and eases accessibility for public data consumers, the quality aspect, or the veracity property (as commonly coined to big data) of open data is the topic of concerned. Not only poor quality data causes misleading results, the reputation of the government as an open data provider can also be negatively affected. Thus, to understand how the government's portals deal with the veracity aspect of their data, in this paper, we present the results of examining quality criteria imposed by selected government's data portals for their data contributors. In particular, we extract quality criteria from the open data policy of the government's data portals under study. The result shows that out of 108 portals, only 27% of the portals explicitly state their quality criteria in the policy, with varying coverage of quality criteria. The frequency of the identified 15 quality criteria shows the types of quality criteria that receive more (and less) attention by the open data portals based on their relative importance. We conclude with suggestions on the areas of further research and development in the government's open data. © 2019, Blue Eyes Intelligence Engineering and Sciences Publication.

Companies in every industry need to train professionals with updated skill-sets in a rapid and continuous manner. However, traditional educational models - university classes and in-person degrees- are increasingly incompatible with the needs of professionals, the market, and society as a whole. New models of education require more flexible, granular and affordable alternatives. MIT is currently developing a new educational framework called Agile Continuous Education (ACE). ACE describes workforce level education offered in a flexible, cost-effective and time-efficient manner by combining individual, group, and real-life mentored learning through multiple traditional and emerging learning modalities. This paper introduces the ACE framework along with its different learning approaches and modalities (e.g. asynchronous and synchronous online courses, virtual synchronous bootcamps, and real-life mentored apprenticeships and internships) and presents the MIT Refugee Action Hub (ReACT) as an illustrative example. MIT ReACT is an institute-wide effort to develop global education programs for underserved communities, including refugees, displaced persons, migrants and economically disadvantaged populations, with the goal of promoting the learner's social integration and formal inclusion into the job market. MIT ReACT's core programs are the Certificate in Computer and Data Science (CDS) and the MicroMasters in Data, Economics and Development Policy, which consist of a combination of online courses, bootcamps, and global apprenticeships. Currently, MIT ReACT has regional presence in the Middle East and North Africa, East Africa, South America, Asia, Europe and North America. © 2022 SEFI 2022 - 50th Annual Conference of the European Society for Engineering Education, Proceedings.

This emerging technology is extraordinary and has the potential to become a source of growth. The telecommunications industry 4.0 is undergoing transformational development to deal with disruptive technological challenges. Globally, quality has declined from the past few decades, a combination of a stagnant economy and an increase in the quality of income has caused dissatisfaction. Inertia services that are often suffered by large companies are often difficult to shake, customer expectations have also shifted in the market, placing the company in a difficult situation in achieving customer satisfaction, agile and innovative technological trends, cost competition, government policy, and this will increase the level of global competition. Exploration case studies and literature reviews are used to test the antecedents of Service Innovation. The study identifies that disruption of technology services offers opportunities for business development to encourage the use of Internet-based services, increasing demand for cheaper and faster internet for consumers. To facing a competitive advantage, organizations have influenced by Service Innovation with the ability to improve big data analytics and organize future knowledge management capabilities, which are agile and flexible in providing information and solutions. From the managerial perspective, this research provides a comprehensive view of what the impact of Service Innovation is on organizations, how to achieve, what variables contribute, and how to relate with performance. The authenticity of this research lies in the description of how management emerges with a practical oriented framework of how organizations must be formed to be innovative and competitive through the general arrangement of antecedents of service innovation.

Hence, taking the IT program management of a bank in China as a case, we explore the methods to solve the problems in multi-project concurrent development practice through integrating the ideas of program and batch management. First, to coordinate the multi-project development process, this paper presents the batch-based agile program management approach that synthesizes concurrent engineering with agile methods. And we compare the application of batch management between software development projects and manufacturing process. Further, we analyze the concurrent multi-project development practice in the batch-based agile program management, including the overlapping between stages, individual project’s activities, and multiple projects based on common resources and environment to stimulate the knowledge transfer.

The value associated with such implementation projects is very closely linked with the efficient use of the project management approach and a robust strategy to handle the technological challenges. This paper puts light on such initiatives implemented in a giant gas field. In this giant gas condensate field, a vast amount of data is generated and monitored on a daily basis. The frequent need to deliver the dynamic production target was driving this project implementation so that a value-driven system can be established while achieving the business KPIs. A phased approach was used to target multiple requirements into business deliverables where the early offline phases provided a robust base for full online integration. This project followed the agile approach focusing on getting insights from multiple stakeholders and domain experts and developing a lesson-learnt repository in all the project phases. The online integration solution is a critical differentiator in the workforce and process efficiency improvement. The multiple technical solution workflows helped in reducing manual efforts and streamlining the methodology in a standardized fashion. In addition, the standard project management practices, such as initializing the phases in a planned manner, followed by an interactive execution, monitoring, and controlling stages, ensured delivering project outcomes in an efficient way. This implementation also established a robust collaborative team effort to identify various different roles and responsibilities for stakeholders. This helped in the end phase when the project sustainability was essential. A strong team base maintained and updated the integrated system while delivering daily well and facility surveillance objectives and KPIs from users ranging from planning, engineering, operation, and management team. A special focus on IT team involvement throughout the project phase led to a successful data integration and diagnostic, as the core of the solution was a data-driven analytical framework integrated with multiple corporate and real-time data sources. In addition, this solution was equipped with various one-of-its-kind solution features such as business intelligence, advanced surveillance, dynamic-reservoir integration, manage-by-exception workflows, intelligence alerts, along with a strong digital framework and data architecture. The unique hybrid and agile project management approach focusing on delivering emerging trends and technologies to end-users in the most efficient way paved the way for achieving asset digitalization and standardization goals. © Copyright 2021, Society of Petroleum Engineers",,"Big data; Digital storage; Gas condensates; Gas industry; Human resource management; Information management; Project management; Reservoir management; Digitisation; Emerging trends; Giant gas fields; Implementation projects; Integrated Asset Modeling; Model application; Oil and Gas Industry; Online integration; Project phasis; Work-flows; Data integration",,,"Society of Petroleum Engineers",,9781613998342,,,"English","Soc.

In the absence of comprehensive traffic monitoring networks with the general lack of intelligent transportation systems (ITSs) and big-data-driven, high-performance-computing (HPC) platforms, it remains challenging to constrain on-road vehicle emissions and capture their hotspots. Here, we established an intelligent modelling and visualization system driven by ITS traffic data for real-world, on-road vehicle emissions. Based on the HPC platform (named “City Brain”) and an agile Web Geographic Information System (WebGISs), this system can map real-time (hourly), hyperfine (10~1000 m) vehicle emissions (e.g., PM2.5, NOx, CO, and HC) and associated traffic states (e.g., vehicle-specific categories and traffic fluxes) over the Xiaoshan District in Hangzhou. Our results show sharp variations in on-road vehicle emissions on small scales, which even fluctuated up to 31.2 times within adjacent road links. Frequent and widespread emission hotspots were also exposed. Over custom spatiotemporal scopes, we virtually investigated and visualized the impacts of traffic control policies on the traffic states and on-road vehicle emissions. Such results have important implications for how traffic control policies should be optimized. Integrating this system with chemical transport models and air quality measurements would bridge the technical gap between air pollutant emissions, concentrations, and human exposure. © 2022 by the authors.

One of the most useful tools in Lean production is Value Stream Mapping (VSM). With focus on visualizing key data of a production process in a single picture, VSM attempts to reveal bottleneck steps in a process. As a consequence, industrial engineers can determine which stages of the process should be put emphasis on improving. However, VSM sole consideration is economics and other aspects of sustainability such as societal and environmental are neglected. With Sustainable Value Stream Mapping (SVSM), all necessary illustrations for a sustainable manufacturing process can be visualized, which leads to higher chances to identify potential problems in the efficiency of production processes beyond the ones identified using lean manufacturing. This research provides a case study where SVSM is applied in an apparel company in order to identify potential issues in the sustainability of their production process.

Deriving these insights accurately and swiftly has become an interest for a range of organizations, including agencies governing districts, city even the whole country, they use these insights to inform policy-makings. Business investors who peak into statistical numbers for estimating current economical situations and future trends. Even for individuals, they could look at some of these insights to better align themselves with macroscopical social trends. There are many challenges to develop these insights in a data-driven approach. First, required data come from a large number of heterogeneous sources in a variety of formats. One single source’s data could be in the size of hundreds of Gigabytes to several TeraBytes, ingesting and governing such huge amount of data is not a small challenge. Second, many complex insights are derived by domain human experts in a trail-and-error fashion, while interacting with data with the aid of computer algorithms. To quickly experiment various algorithms, it asks for software capabilities for infusing human experts and machine intelligence together, this is challenging but critical for success. By designing and implementing a flexible big data stack that could bring in a variety of data components. We address some of the challenges to infuse data, computer algorithm and human together in Zilian Tech company [20].

The stack is designed to be equipped with scalable storage that could scale up to PetaBytes, as well as elastic distributed compute engine with parallel computing algorithms. With these features the data stack enables a) swift data analysis, by human analysts interacting with data and machine algorithms via software support, with on-demand question answering time reduced from days to minutes; b) agile building of data products for end users to interact with, in weeks if not days from months. © 2022, The Author(s).","Cloud; Data stack; Social development","Digital storage; Economic and social effects; 'current; Data stack; Data-driven approach; Future trends; Heterogeneous sources; Human expert; Policy making; Social development; Social trend; Statistical numbers; Big data","Huang, H.; University of MelbourneAustralia; email: hhhu@student.unimelb.edu.au","Qian Z.Jabbar M.A.Li X.","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH",18761100,9789811924552,,,"English","Lect.

Here we present an integrated approach to the digitalization of an O&G plant aiming to offer operator safety enhancement, production optimization and reduction of the environmental impact to maximize the asset value. This has been accomplished by complex and continuous work powered by the people who are the engine and the real target of the digital transformation process. In the key study hereby presented, an all-round effort has been made to empower the operator's everyday work with digital and innovative tools supporting reservoir, maintenance, production and HSE workflow. Starting from a number of various legacy systems, a single integrated dashboard was built: The Integrated Operation Centre (IOC). IOC is now available on PC and smartphones to all site personnel both at the operational and managerial level. New innovative systems were developed and deployed into IOC to capitalize on the data acquired during years of plant activities. Machine learning and advanced analytics solutions provide new daily insight on how to efficiently schedule maintenance operations and avoid off-specs and downtime on critical equipment, while complex production optimizers help technicians react to unexpected situations and maximize production. Via IoT (Internet of Things) and portable devices, new tools and workflows were deployed onsite to ease the work and enhance the safety of workers with focus on usage of PPE and providing rapid information to locate workers during emergency situations. People from both site and company headquarters ensured the success of the digital transformation by working together in an Agile Method during the development phase and by coaching in the roll-out phase. New professional roles, like data scientist and big data engineers, joined effort with experienced operators to ensure the success of this journey. This cooperation was at the basis of a comprehensive change management effort, which ensured a smooth and constant change in the way the personnel thinks, acts and reacts. This, we believe, is at the very heart of any fundamental transformation, being it digital or not.

First — and even in the absence of key performance indicators — it improves marketing efficiency, as life-cycle marketing, automated price adjustment and programmatic advertising based on artificial intelligence (AI) all support the vision of fully standardised marketing automation, with real-time, optimised customer centricity. Secondly, new marketing areas such as viral marketing, social media marketing and content marketing emphasise the increasing significance of creative marketing. Looking for paradigmatic principles reveals that performance marketing is shaped by analytic, processual and lean thinking. In contrast, creative marketing depends on agile outside-in thinking as a key element in the debate regarding marketing 3.0. Thus, digitisation seems to foster paradigmatic incompatibilities within marketing 4.0.

Notwithstanding strong managerial and academic interest, this link between digitalization and servitization is still under-investigated. Depth interviews with senior executives and managers from a global market leader revealed that to achieve digital service-led growth, a firm and its network need to make three interconnected shifts: (1) from planning to discovery, (2) from scarcity to abundance, and (3) from hierarchy to partnership. Organizational identity, dematerialization, and collaboration play a key role in this transformation.

Compared to larger corporations, the creative ecosystem in which they operate depends on “quick business” and requires them to be more agile, adaptive and faster when identifying hidden potential within their networks. Moreover, their interdisciplinary and collaborative ways of working create emerging opportunities for spin-off companies and other entrepreneurial ventures. This study (part of the Arts API Project) aimed to examine the networks of arts organisations to understand some of their defining features and characteristics. The project aimed to show that by visualising and analysing relational data, it was envisioned that arts organisations would be able to operate on a more evidence-based, commercial and entrepreneurial basis, enabling better informed decision making and more defined business strategies. This paper focuses on the role and value of big data in the Arts and Humanities, provides the context and background to the Arts API Project and outlines the methodological approach, presenting one particular aspect of the larger research project. Adopting the technique of Social Network Analysis (SNA), the networks of five UK-based art organisations were visually mapped and analysed using measures such as Density, Connectivity, Centralization and Clique Participation Index. Within the limitations of the study, the findings reveal valuable insights on the effect of de/centralisation of information flow within creative networks, the importance of maintaining a balance between weak and strong network ties and mitigating risk by distributing responsibility across networks. © 2022, Academic Conferences and Publishing International Limited.

This digital transformation through agile drivers will help address the increasing challenges of urbanization in a couple of decades. The Cyber-Physical System (CPS) is becoming pervasive in every aspect of smart city daily life and considered as one of the four fundamental conceptual approaches of the fourth generation industrial revolution (Industry 4.0). CPS used to describe the next generation of a diverse spectrum of complicated, multidisciplinary, physically comprehending engineered systems that integrates embedded cyber aspects into the physical world. It implants computation technologies, communication control, the convergence of information, and physical processes together with strategic importance internationally. CPS is still a vast research area. As a result, it opens venues for applications across multiple scales. This paper presents an in-depth survey of the related works, focusing on the design and how it relates to different research fields, current concepts, and real-life applications to understand CPS more precisely. Further, it enumerates an extensive set of CPS challenges and opportunities, introducing visionary ideas, research strategies, and future trends expected for future-oriented technological solutions, like cloud computing, Internet of Things, and Big Data. These technological solutions are to play a critical role in CPS research and have significant impacts on the smart city. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","Big Data; Cloud computing; Cyber-physical systems; Future trends; Industry 4.0; Internet of Things; Research strategies; Smart city","Big data; Cloud computing; Cyber Physical System; Industry 4.0; Intelligent systems; Internet of things; Smart city; Communication control; Cyber-physical systems (CPS); Digital transformation; Future trends; Industrial revolutions; Real-life applications; Research strategy; Technological solution; Embedded systems","Juma, M.; Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology, Block 11, 1st and 2nd Floor, United Arab Emirates; email: Mazen.Juma@gmail.com","Hassanien A.E.Shaalan K.Tolba M.F.","Springer",21945357,9783030311285,,,"English","Adv.

However, the centralized and exhaustively detailed approach of conventional EA is susceptible to failure when employed in organizations demonstrating exceedingly great size, speed of operation and change, and IT complexity – a combination of traits that characterizes, for example, some emerging types of “technologized” oligopolistic megacorps reflecting the Industry 4.0 paradigm. This text develops the conceptual basis for a variant form of enterprise architecture that can be used to enact improved target architectures for organizations whose characteristics would otherwise render them “unmanageable” from the perspective of conventional EA. The proposed approach of “enterprise meta-architecture” (or EMA) disengages human enterprise architects from the fine-grained details of architectural analysis, design, and implementation, which are handled by artificially intelligent systems functioning as active agents rather than passive tools. The role of the human enterprise architect becomes one of determining the types of performance improvements a target architecture should ideally generate, establishing the operating parameters for an EMA system, and monitoring and optimizing its functioning. Advances in Big Data and parametric design provide models for enterprise meta-architecture, which is distinct from other new approaches like agile and adaptive EA. Deployment of EMA systems should become feasible as ongoing advances in AI result in an increasing share of organizational agency and decision-making responsibility being shifted to artificial agents. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Enterprise architecture; Industry 4.0; Megacorps; Organizational complexity; Parametric design; Unmanageability","Decision making; Industry 4.0; Information systems; Information use; Intelligent systems; Enterprise Architecture; Megacorps; Organizational complexity; Parametric design; Unmanageability; Big data","Gladden, M.E.; Institute of Computer Science, Poland; email: matthew.e.gladden@gmail.com","Wilimowska Z.Borzemski L.Swiatek J.","Springer Verlag",21945357,9783319999920,,,"English","Adv.

The primary concept of these language interpreters is that they usually generate a set of machine code-like instructions (often called “bytecode”) instead of directly generating machine code for the targeted platform. This does not only allow programmers to follow program execution instantly but also to develop and deploy applications more efficiently, often in combination with agile practices. Their first simple functional prototypes are usually implemented in another high-level language such as Python, Java, or JavaScript due to larger flexibility for implementing algorithms and the language grammar and later converted to a low-level system language such as C or C++ with special emphasis on memory management and bytecode optimizations. This paper presents some of the common examples, approaches, and algorithms for implementing such systems with sufficient or acceptable portability and efficiency, and also describes the design and implementation of Stella, a simple, yet powerful and user-friendly dynamic programming language designed to provide an optimal infrastructure for scalable and safe object-oriented design. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Bytecode; Call frame; Closure; Garbage collection; Interpreter; Java; Parsing; Python; Stack-based virtual machine; UML; Visual Paradigm",,"Muhić, S.; Polytechnic Faculty, Bosnia and Herzegovina; email: sanid.muhic@gmail.com","Ademovic N.Mulic M.Mujcic E.Kevric J.Aksamija Z.","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH",23673370,9783031176968,,,"English","Lect.

By analyzing big data streams generated through IoT devices, city planners now have the possibility to optimize traffic and mobility patterns. IoT combined with innovative transport concepts as well as emerging mobility modes (e.g., ridesharing and carsharing) constitute a new paradigm in sustainable and optimized traffic operations in smart cities. Still, these are highly dynamic scenarios, which are also subject to a high uncertainty degree. Hence, factors such as real-time optimization and re-optimization of routes, stochastic travel times, and evolving customers’ requirements and traffic status also have to be considered. This paper discusses the main challenges associated with Internet of Vehicles (IoV) and vehicle networking scenarios, identifies the underlying optimization problems that need to be solved in real time, and proposes an approach to combine the use of IoV with parallelization approaches. To this aim, agile optimization and distributed machine learning are envisaged as the best candidate algorithms to develop efficient transport and mobility systems. © 2022 by the authors.","agile optimization; data analytics; distributed machine learning; Internet of Vehicles; IoT analytics; smart cities; vehicle networking",,"Tarchi, D.; Department of Electrical, Italy; email: daniele.tarchi@unibo.it",,"MDPI",26248921,,,,"English","Vehicle.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85144654376

They are signaled by a disturbance in a well given the influence of a neighboring well. We can classify three types of interferences: Completion to Drilling, Drilling to Production and Completion to Production. The last kind, also known as a frac-hit, is the subject of this study, being the most frequent and with the most productivity impact, caused by liquid loading or wells shut-in. The goal of this project is to deliver an early frac-hit detection system for Vaca Muerta’s natural flowing wells integrated into YPF’s Unconventional Decision Support Center (DSC). Using this system, shutting certain wells for frac-hit protection could be avoided, shutting them in when there is a deviation from natural well-head pressure decline. To achieve this objective, we use real-time pressure data from well head pressure gauges. The trend component of the head pressure time series is extracted, and a model is made using one-month data for each well. The model forecasts the next 3 days of well head pressure, predicting its's natural decay and it was tested with a set of 34 wells labeled as interfered. By comparing the modelled pressure with the real data, we can detect the beginning of the interference when the pressure difference is above a defined threshold, and the difference persists a given number of hours. An alarm is raised when these conditions are met. The alarm is displayed in a dashboard accessible for DSC supervisors, and operational engineers, to take corrective actions, e.g.: decide which wells need to be shut-in. Monitoring begins when the fracking equipment starts the new well stimulation process. If no alarms are registered, the model is automatically recalculated. As a result of this work, a dashboard for monitoring the state of natural flowing wells on the DSC was developed. We can expect to have less production loss for wells shut-in, unless an early frac-hit detection alarm is raised. This work is directly applied to the unconventional play of Vaca Muerta, decreasing the supervisory needs to detect frac-hits when several frac rigs are operating simultaneously with tens of wells under risk of being hit. The novelty is the application of time series analytics over well head pressure data to enhance DSC’s supervisor’s productivity and decrease production losses for the unconventional assets.

Each new use case requires developing its own machine learning (ML) solution. A ML solution integrates different software components to read, process, and analyze all use case data, as well as to finally generate the output that domain experts need for their decision-making. The process to design a system specification for a ML solution is not straight-forward. It entails two types of complexity: (1) The technical complexity of selecting combinations of ML algorithms and software components that suit a use case; (2) the organizational complexity of integrating different requirements from a multidisciplinary team of, e.g., domain experts, data scientists, and IT specialists. In this paper, we propose several adaptations to Axiomatic Design in order to design ML solution specifications that handle these complexities. We call this Axiomatic Design for Machine Learning (AD4ML). We apply AD4ML to specify a ML solution for a fault detection use case and discuss to what extent our approach conquers the above-mentioned complexities. We also discuss how AD4ML facilitates the agile design of ML solutions. © 2020 IEEE.","design; machine-learning; manufacturing","Data integration; Data Science; Decision making; Design; Fault detection; Machine learning; Manufacture; Specifications; Axiomatic design; Domain experts; Multi-disciplinary teams; Organizational complexity; Production line; Software component; System specification; Technical complexity; Information use",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781728110547,,,"English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

We investigate the type of navigational structures/design resulting from creative reuse/refactoring and lean management; and whether there will be evidences of knowledge induction from randomized search scaffolded by Case-based Reasoning (CBR), which leads to heuristic transfer and learning.

This transformation is a huge undertaking impacting all aspects of the software development life cycle (SDLC), including the quality management system. This paper presents a case study of a large-scale transformation of a legacy quality management system to a modern system developed and implemented at Cisco Systems. The framework for this transformation is defined by six distinct areas: metrics, process, measurement, reporting, quality analytics, and culture & leadership. Our implementation leveraged recent advances in Machine Learning (ML), Artificial Intelligence (AI), connected data, integrated operations, and big data technologies to solve the challenges created by a hybrid software development organization.

Modern software development in Industry 4.0 is complex process, both human-intensive, technology-intensive, knowledge- intensive and innovative-intensive. The modern software industry moves unrelentingly towards new methods for managing the ever-increasing complexity of software projects. The traditional project management methodology, which contains structured and standardized forms, and is focused on a greater certainty and planning horizon of several decades, no longer allows companies to fully adapt to the new opportunities, speeds and risks of Industry 4.0. The article systematizes new conceptual approaches and forms of projects management, including adaptive management methodologies. Agile-based digital project management creates new opportunities for business: accelerating decision-making and the rapid identification of incorrect approaches, effective cooperation between technical groups and business groups, creating a more attractive environment for collaboration and co-working, reducing the time to prepare documentation and others. The transformation of software project management is associated with dramatic changes, the risk of errors when updating products, diluting responsibility for product quality, and even problems with the companies reputation.

The urgent decision-making needs of invasive species managers can be better met by the integration of biodiversity big data with large-domain models and data-driven products. Remotely sensed data products can be combined with existing invasive species occurrence data via machine learning models to provide the proactive spatial risk analysis necessary for implementing coordinated and agile management paradigms across large scales. We present a workflow that generates rapid spatial risk assessments on aquatic invasive species using occurrence data, spatially explicit environmental data, and an ensemble approach to species distribution modeling using five machine learning algorithms. For proof of concept and validation, we tested this workflow using extensive spatial and temporal hybridization and occurrence data from a well-studied, ongoing, and climate-driven species invasion in the upper Flathead River system in northwestern Montana, USA. Rainbow Trout (RBT; Oncorhynchus mykiss), an introduced species in the Flathead River basin, compete and readily hybridize with native Westslope Cutthroat Trout (WCT; O. clarkii lewisii), and the spread of RBT individuals and their alleles has been tracked for decades. We used remotely sensed and other geospatial data as key environmental predictors for projecting resultant habitat suitability to geographic space. The ensemble modeling technique yielded high accuracy predictions relative to 30-fold cross-validated datasets (87% 30-fold cross-validated accuracy score). Both top predictors and model performance relative to these predictors matched current understanding of the drivers of RBT invasion and habitat suitability, indicating that temperature is a major factor influencing the spread of invasive RBT and hybridization with native WCT. The congruence between more time-consuming modeling approaches and our rapid machine-learning approach suggest that this workflow could be applied more broadly to provide data-driven management information for early detection of potential invaders. © Copyright © 2021 Carter, van Rees, Hand, Muhlfeld, Luikart and Kimball.","big data analytics; early detection and rapid response; invasive species; machine learning; remote sensing; species distribution modeling",,"Carter, S.; Numerical Terradynamic Simulation Group, United States; email: sean2.carter@umontana.edu",,"Frontiers Media S.A.",2624909X,,,,"English","Frontiers.

Here, we introduce a collaborative, demand-driven methodology for the development of a strategic adolescent mental health research agenda. Ultimately, this agenda aims to guide future data sharing and collection efforts that meet the most pressing data needs of key stakeholders. Methods: We conducted a rapid literature search to summarize common themes in adolescent mental health research into a “topic map”. We then hosted two virtual workshops with a range of international experts to discuss the topic map and identify shared priorities for future collaboration and research. Results: Our topic map identifies 10 major themes in adolescent mental health, organized into system-level, community-level, and individual-level categories. The engagement of cross-sectoral experts resulted in the validation of the mapping exercise, critical insights for refining the topic map, and a collaborative list of priorities for future research. Discussion: This innovative agile methodology enables a focused deliberation with diverse stakeholders and can serve as the starting point for data generation and collaboration practices, both in the field of adolescent mental health and other topics. © 2022 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine","Adolescents; Agenda setting; Crowdsourcing; Data science; Iinternational; Mental health; Questions; Research","adolescent; article; clinical article; crowdsourcing; data science; exercise; female; human; human experiment; male; mental health; mental health research; adolescent health; vulnerable population; Adolescent; Adolescent Health; Humans; Mental Health; Vulnerable Populations","Verhulst, S.; The Governance Lab, 260 18th Street; email: stefaan@thegovlab.org",,"Elsevier Inc.",1054139X,,JADHE,"35931647","English","J.

The IT service infrastructure as enabler of innovative business models has to support these innovations by providing agile methods to quickly adapt to new use-cases. This underlines the need to manage the digitized environment systematically in order to foster efficiency. IT Service Management (ITSM) as a discipline evolved and now provides the framework to orchestrate the complexity in Information Technology. The activities, processes, and capabilities to maintain the portfolio are served by individuals, who interact with each other. There is an emphasized need for identifying, acquiring, organizing, storing, retrieving, and analyzing data related to human interaction processes to support finally the business processes. This paper proposes a conceptual data model to capture information about human interactions during support ticket administration (DMISTA). The presented model-structure and -requirements allow for efficient selection of appropriate data for various data science use-cases to understand and optimize business processes. The DMISTA supports different types of relationships (based on causality, joint cases, and joint activities) to enable efficient processing of specific analysis methods. The applicability of the model is shown based on a typical use-case. Copyright © 2022 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

This competition has led to the development of new strategies to manage demand and increase market share. Among these strategies are the growing interest in sustainable manufacturing and the need for customizable products that create an increasingly complex manufacturing environment. Sustainable manufacturing and the need for customizable products create an environment of increased competition and constant change. Indeed, companies are trying to establish more flexible and agile manufacturing systems through several systems of reconfiguration. Reconfiguration contributes to an extension of the manufacturing system’s life cycle by modifying its physical, organizational and IT characteristics according to the changing market conditions. Due to the rapid development of new information technology (such as IoT, Big Data analytics, cyber-physical systems, cloud computing and artificial intelligence), digital twins have become intensively used in smart manufacturing.

A recent integration of wireless and mobile cyber-physical systems, with dramatically growing smart sensors, enable new types of pervasive smart and mobile urban surveillance infrastructures that open up new opportunities for boosting the accuracy, efficiency, and productivity of uninterrupted target tracking and situational awareness. Wireless sensors provide the tool for communications and security applications. They offer low-power, multi-functioning and computational capabilities. In this paper, we present a design and prototype of an efficient and effective fog system using light-weight agile software-defined control for mobile wireless nodes. Fog computing or edge computing, a recently proposed extension and complement for cloud computing, enables computing at the network edge in a smart device without outsourcing jobs to a remote cloud.

In this paper, we introduce the AI-SPRINT project, which will provide solutions to seamlessly design, partition, and run AI applications in computing continuum environments. AI-SPRINT will offer novel tools for AI applications development, secure execution, easy deployment, as well as runtime management and optimization: AI-SPRINT design tools will allow trading-off application performance (in terms of end-toend latency or throughput), energy efficiency, and AI models accuracy while providing security and privacy guarantees.

Given the increasing use of these platforms, it is important to characterize their performance and robustness in real application scenarios. The paper analyzes the ThingSpeak platform by measuring the latencies associated to data packets sent to cloud and replied back, and by checking the consistency of the returned data. Several experiments were done considering different ways to access the platform: REST API, MQTT API, and MQTT broker alone. For each experiment, the methodology is explained, results are presented, and conclusions are extracted. The REST and MQTT APIs have similar performances, with roundtrip times between 1 s and 3 s. The MQTT broker alone is more agile, with roundtrip times below 250 ms. In all cases, the up and down links are far from being symmetric, with the uplink delay showing higher variance than the downlink delay. The obtained results can serve as a reference for other IoT platforms and provide guidelines for application development. © 2021 ASTES Publishers.

Nevertheless, cloud computing is still in its premature stage and experiences lack of standardization. The security issues are the main challenges to cloud computing adoption. Thus, critical industries such as government organizations (ministries) are reluctant to trust cloud computing due to the fear of losing their sensitive data, as it resides on the cloud with no knowledge of data location and lack of transparency of Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) mechanisms used to secure their data and applications which have created a barrier against adopting this agile computing paradigm.

We describe how DAR, offered by the Mathematical Sciences Department at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI), is an essential part of an early low-barrier pipeline into data analytics studies and careers for diverse students. Students first take a foundational course, typically Introduction to Data Mathematics, that teaches linear algebra, data analytics, and R programming simultaneously using a project-based learning (PBL) approach. Then in DAR, students work in teams on open applied data analytics research problems provided by the clients. We describe the DAR organization which is inspired in part by agile software development practices. Students meet for coaching sessions with instructors multiple times a week and present to clients frequently. In a fully remote format during the pandemic, the students continued to be highly successful and engaged in COVID-19 research producing significant results as indicated by deployed online applications, refereed papers, and conference presentations. Formal evaluation shows that the pipeline of the single on-ramp course followed by DAR addressing real-world problems with societal benefits is highly effective at developing students' data analytics skills, advancing creative problem solvers who can work both independently and in teams, and attracting students to further studies and careers in data science. © The Author(s) & Dept. of Mathematical Sciences The University of Montana","Course-based undergraduate research; Data analytics; Data visualization; Linear algebra; Machine learning; Project-based learning; Undergraduate education",,,,"University of Montana - ScholarWorks",15513440,,,,"English","Math.

Policy and service innovation labs constitute one part of a broader “open innovation” movement which also includes open data, behavioral insights, digital services, data science units, visualization capabilities, and agile and lean methods. This article argues that we need to step back and better understand these “ecologies” of innovation capabilities that have emerged across public service institutions, and to recognize that as fellow “innovation” traveling companions they collectively seek to transform the culture of government and public service institutions, producing more effective, efficient and tailored policies and services. This article introduces analytic frameworks that should help locate policy and innovation labs amidst these other innovating entities. First, it delineates the various units and initiatives which can be seen as committed to new ways of working and innovating in public service institutions, often relying on “open innovation” rhetoric and approaches. Second, it shows how–despite the diversity among these entities–they nevertheless share similar attributes as “adhocracies” and are located as part of a broader movement and class of organizations. Third, we locate these diverse OI entities amidst broader public service systems using the Competing Values Framework. Fourth, this article situates the challenges confronting OI units developing and sustaining or broadening niches in public service systems.

Approximate query processing (AQP) is one of the useful approaches in agile analytics, which facilitates fast queries on big data by leveraging a pre-computed sample. One problem such a sample faces is that when new data is being imported, re-sampling is most likely needed to keep the sample fresh and AQP results accurate enough. Re-sampling from scratch for every batch of new data, called the full re-sampling method and adopted by many existing AQP works, is obviously a very costly process, and a much quicker incremental sampling process, such as reservoir sampling, may be used to cover the newly arrived data. However, incremental update methods suffer from the fact that the sample size cannot be increased, which is a problem when the underlying data distribution dramatically changes and the sample needs to be enlarged to maintain the AQP accuracy. This paper proposes an adaptive sample update (ASU) approach that avoids re-sampling from scratch as much as possible by monitoring the data distribution, and uses instead an incremental update method before a re-sampling becomes necessary. The paper also proposes an enhanced approach (T-ASU), which tries to enlarge the sample size without re-sampling from scratch when a bit of query inaccuracy is tolerable to further reduce the sample update cost. These two approaches are integrated into a state-of-the-art AQP engine for an extensive experimental study. Experimental results on both real-world and synthetic datasets show that the two approaches are faster than the full re-sampling method while achieving almost the same AQP accuracy when the underlying data distribution continuously changes. © 2020 IEEE.",,"Data processing; Approximate query processing; Competitive advantage; Incremental samplings; Incremental updates; Maintenance approaches; Resampling method; Reservoir samplings; Synthetic datasets; Competition",,,"IEEE Computer Society",10844627,9781728129037,,,"English","Proc Int Conf Data Eng",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085858288

Functional silos on demand and supply fronts of products are required to be addressed to implement the de-coupling point in preferences of consumers involved in a supply chain for optimization of operational efficiency, and nowadays, it has become a challenge. Again, ‘Amazon Effect’ has forced others to reset their strategies for optimizing their effectiveness. For the optimization of operational efficiency, three technologies have been used in the present work. TOPSIS, one of the Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) Techniques, has been applied to provide preferences of consumers of different criteria against different attributes (products). For tracking the products on transit, Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID) method can be employed in SCM to collect and share data of event(s) or ‘Things’ for a broad range through the Internet of Things (IoT) application. Finally, Cloud Computing has been proposed to be applied for managing Big Data that will be generated during this entire process of SCM. The optimization method of a quick or agile SCM based on TOPSIS, IoT and Cloud Computing is discussed in detail in this work to benefit industries. © 2020, The Institution of Engineers (India).","Agile SCM; Amazon effect; Consumers’ preference; De-coupling; Functional silos; IoT; RFID; SCM; Supply chain; TOPSIS","Cloud computing; Data Sharing; Decision making; Efficiency; Radio frequency identification (RFID); Supply chain management; De-coupling; Internet of thing (IOT); Multi-criteria decision making; On demands; Operational efficiencies; Optimization method; Supply chain managements (SCM); Internet of things","Das, S.; Department of Mechanical Engineering, India; email: sdas.me@gmail.com",,"Springer",22500545,,,,"English","J.

In the industrial field, Lean Manufacturing (LM) is widely recognized as a traditional approach to eliminate waste in the value stream and ensure the efficiency of production processes. On the other hand, Industry 4.0 has recently emerged, incurring disruptive changes in manufacturing processes based on a technology-driven approach. The integration of these two philosophies to achieve organizational goals is interesting in order to guarantee competitiveness, especially for man-ufacturing companies. This paper proposed an integration of LM tools and technologies 4.0, considering the perspectives of the industrial field in the digital era. Based on a three-step methodology, which included technological and industrial mapping, it was identified 25 synergy points. From interactions of LM tools mainly with Big Data Analytics, The Cloud, Virtual Simulation and Augmented Reality, multi-level circular diagrams pointed out the main contributions of Just in Time 4.0 (JIT 4.0), Kaizen 4.0, Kanban 4.0, Poka-Yoke 4.0, Value Stream Mapping 4.0 (VSM 4.0) and Total Productive Maintenance 4.0 (TPM 4.0).

Many types of technological problems that were once considered prohibitively expensive to tackle are now candidates for exploration. Machine Learning (ML) tools that were valued only in academic environments are quickly being embraced by industrial giants and tiny startups alike. Coupled with modern-day computing power, ML tools can be looked at as hammers that can deal with even the most stubborn nails. ML tools have become so ubiquitous that the current industrial expectation is that they should not only deliver accurate and intelligent solutions but also do so rapidly. In order to keep pace with these requirements, a new enterprise, referred to as MLOps has blossomed in recent years. MLOps combines the process of ML and DS with an agile software engineering technique to develop and deliver solutions in a fast and iterative way. One of the key challenges to this is that ML and DS tools should be efficient and have better usability characteristics than were traditionally offered. In this paper, we present a novel software for Grammatical Evolution (GE) that meets both of these expectations. Our tool, GELAB, is a toolbox for GE in Matlab which has numerous features that distinguish it from existing contemporary GE software. Firstly, it is user-friendly and its development was aimed for use by non-specialists. Secondly, it is capable of hybrid optimization, in which standard numerical optimization techniques can be added to GE. We have shown experimentally that when hybridized with meta-heuristics GELAB has an overall better performance as compared with standard GE. © 2013 IEEE.","diversity; Grammatical evolution; hybrid optimization","Computational grammars; High level languages; Iterative methods; MATLAB; Optimization; Diversity; Germaniums (Ge); Grammar; Grammatical evolution; Hybrid optimization; Learning tool; Machine-learning; Matlab; Optimisations; Software; Germanium","Youssef, A.; Bio-Computing and Developmental Systems (BDS) Research Group, Ireland; email: aiman.mahgoub@ul.ie",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",21693536,,,,"English","IEEE Access",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85128281046

This goal has forced organizations to evolve their development processes. We report on a study that we conducted on observing software teams at Microsoft as they develop AI-based applications. We consider a nine-stage workflow process informed by prior experiences developing AI applications (e.g., search and NLP) and data science tools (e.g. application diagnostics and bug reporting). We found that various Microsoft teams have united this workflow into preexisting, well-evolved, Agile-like software engineering processes, providing insights about several essential engineering challenges that organizations may face in creating large-scale AI solutions for the marketplace. We collected some best practices from Microsoft teams to address these challenges. In addition, we have identified three aspects of the AI domain that make it fundamentally different from prior software application domains: 1) discovering, managing, and versioning the data needed for machine learning applications is much more complex and difficult than other types of software engineering, 2) model customization and model reuse require very different skills than are typically found in software teams, and 3) AI components are more difficult to handle as distinct modules than traditional software components-models may be 'entangled' in complex ways and experience non-monotonic error behavior. We believe that the lessons learned by Microsoft teams will be valuable to other organizations. © 2019 IEEE.","Artifical Intelligence; Data; Machine Learning; Process; Software Engineering","Computer software reusability; Engineering education; Learning systems; Machine components; Machine learning; Processing; Software engineering; Artifical intelligence; Data; Development process; Engineering challenges; Information technology sector; Machine learning applications; Software applications; Software engineering process; Application programs",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781728117607,,,"English","Proc. - IEEE/ACM Int.

These lead them to improve their responsiveness and flexibility to meet the varying needs of customers to cope with these constraints. Several industrial companies have adopted the lean manufacturing (LM) concept based on the Toyota production system to reduce wastage according to a methodical and structured approach that has given this proof for several years. This approach currently finds its limits, since it is based on static data. A dynamic approach, real-time data on customer needs and production performance will readjust the levers of lean manufacturing to improve its efficiency. This paper aims to show that the concept Industry 4.0 incarnates the lean manufacturing approach by feeding a real-time data and a real-time analysis of Big Data in a Cyber Physical Production System (CPPS), in order to improve decision-making and re-adjust real time levers of the lean manufacturing approach. © The Authors 2021.

This wild digital phenomenon, also thanks to the introduction of 4.0 industry, is changing the relationship between workers and machines and, if properly governed, can represent a great chance for companies to attain advantages and create value. This stimulating scenario embodies a huge opportunity for HRM. It provides impulses to improve positive social change, as well as develop and adopt new digital systems and innovative organizational solutions. HR professionals can help employees use digital 4.0 modes to manage, organize and drive change. To address this opportunity, HRM 4.0 has to collaborate with IT, spread an agile mind to execute projects, adopt design thinking and use integrated analytics. This paper presents an organizational model based on a technology platform designed for business workers and able to fill the gap between own skills and the request from the labour market. A theoretical framework is proposed, based on an innovative integrated system able to implement the entire workflow of evaluation, selection and training of candidates with the final aims of allowing companies to identify, manage and build business workers’ competencies.

Software Defined Networks is a networking paradigm that makes the network agile by disaggregating hardware and software. SDN helps enhance security with the help of micro-segmentation. The controller maintains a central view of the network, and its ability to monitor and store network information helps optimize routing. The centralization nature of the controller makes it vulnerable to DoS attacks which can be catastrophic for network functioning. The objective of this paper is to secure the distributed SDN controller architecture against DoS attacks. The proposed architecture is robust, scalable, and uses Big Data techniques to process streams of network traffic in real-time and Machine Learning to detect and mitigate DoS attacks. © 2019 IEEE.","DoS Attack; Kafka; RyuController; Software Defined Networks; Storm; Zodiac FX","Cloud computing; Commerce; Controllers; Data streams; Denial-of-service attack; Controller architectures; Hardware and software; Network information; Network traffic; Proposed architectures; Risk mitigating; Security breaches; Security enhancing; Network architecture",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781728163345,,,"English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

To ensure the security of the DREN system, a defense system known as the Cybersecurity Environment for Detection, Analysis, and Reporting (CEDAR) was created. CEDAR contains a variety of cybersecurity sensors, which constantly monitor and record real time network activity on the DREN. over time, CEDAR has accumulated massive quantities of valuable cybersecurity data, which necessitates a form of automation in the process of reviewing this data. We propose the application of deep learning techniques to CEDAR data in an attempt to automatically detect potentially malicious activity in a more agile and adaptable manner. These deep learning techniques can be carried out in a high performance computing (HPC) environment, allowing for the rapid utilization of large amounts of data.

Supported by Cloud and Fog/Edge infrastructures – on the one hand, and Big Data processing techniques – on the other, existing approaches, however, primarily adopt a vertical offloading model that is heavily dependent on the underlying network bandwidth. That is, (constrained) network communication remains the main limitation to achieve truly agile IoT data management and processing. This paper aims to bridge this gap by defining Clustered Edge Computing – a new approach to enable rapid data processing at the very edge of the IoT network by clustering edge devices into fully functional decentralized ensembles, capable of workload distribution and balancing to accomplish relatively complex computational tasks. This paper also proposes ECStream Processing that implements Clustered Edge Computing using Stream Processing techniques to enable dynamic in-memory computation close to the data source. By spreading the workload among a cluster of collocated edge devices to process data in parallel, the proposed approach aims to improve performance, thereby supporting agile data management. The experimental results confirm that such a distributed in-memory approach to data processing at the very edge of an IoT network can outperform currently adopted Cloud-enabled architectures, and has the potential to address a wide range of IoT-related data-intensive time-critical scenarios. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","cloud computing; clustered edge computing; data agility; edge computing; internet of things; stream processing","Cloud computing; Data streams; Edge computing; Information management; data agility; Data processing techniques; Improve performance; Memory computations; Network communications; Stream processing; Underlying networks; Work-load distribution; Internet of things","Dautov, R.; Kazan Federal UniversityRussian Federation; email: rdautov@it.kfu.ru",,"John Wiley and Sons Ltd",15320626,,CCPEB,,"English","Concurr.

Failure in the steps of requirements elicitation can lead to a lack of definition of user needs for the application so that it has an impact on the quality and usability of the software produced. That will also affect the application of children's education, where without involving children in the elicitation process, it can make the software built not by the age development needs of the child. Failure in requirements elicitation occurs because of lack of knowledge of analysts in communicating and choosing elicitation techniques. Both components have a close relationship with the type of users who will become respondents. Nowadays, requirements elicitation framework tends to pay more attention to adults and parents, while for children it is still not found. Children have different characteristics with adults and parents, so it needs to be considered in carrying out approaches or techniques in performing elicitation. The selection of elicitation techniques that are not by the characteristics of children can cause failure in exploring the needs of children for child learning applications built. Based on these problems, we need a requirements elicitation framework in children's education applications. The requirements for the elicitation framework are expected to make it easier for child learning application developers to get application requirements that are appropriate for the child's developmental age. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","Agile method; Child learning application; Framework; Requirements elicitation; Requirements engineering; Usability","Big data; Computer aided instruction; Information management; Requirements engineering; Safety engineering; Agile methods; Application developers; Application requirements; Elicitation techniques; Framework; Requirement elicitation; Requirements elicitation; Usability; Application programs",,,"Association for Computing Machinery",,9781450366427,,,"English","ACM Int.

In addition to limited scope representativeness and lack of robust methodological approaches in driving research design and evaluation of bioethics ontologies, no bioethics ontologies exist for pandemics and COVID-19. This research attempted to investigate whether studying the bioethics research literature, from the inception of bioethics research publications, facilitates developing highly agile, and representative computational bioethics ontology as a foundation for the automatic governance of bioethics processes in general and the COVID-19 pandemic in particular. Research Design: The iOntoBioethics agile research framework adopted the Design Science Research Methodology. Using systematic literature mapping, the search space resulted in 26,170 Scopus indexed bioethics articles, published since 1971. iOntoBioethics underwent two distinctive stages: (1) Manually Constructing Bioethics (MCB) ontology from selected bioethics sources, and (2) Automatically generating bioethics ontological topic models with all 26,170 sources and using special-purpose developed Text Mining and Machine-Learning (TM&ML) engine. Bioethics domain experts validated these ontologies, and further extended to construct and validate the Bioethics COVID-19 Pandemic Ontology. Results: Cross-validation of the MCB and TM&ML bioethics ontologies confirmed that the latter provided higher-level abstraction for bioethics entities with well-structured bioethics ontology class hierarchy compared to the MCB ontology. However, both bioethics ontologies were found to complement each other forming a highly comprehensive Bioethics Ontology with around 700 concepts and associations COVID-19 inclusive. Conclusion: The iOntoBioethics framework yielded the first agile, semi-automatically generated, literature-based, and domain experts validated General Bioethics and Bioethics Pandemic Ontologies Operable in COVID-19 context with readiness for automatic governance of bioethics processes. These ontologies will be regularly and semi-automatically enriched as iOntoBioethics is proposed as an open platform for scientific and healthcare communities, in their infancy COVID-19 learning stage. iOntoBioethics not only it contributes to better understanding of bioethics processes, but also serves as a bridge linking these processes to healthcare systems. Such big data analytics platform has the potential to automatically inform bioethics governance adherence given the plethora of developing bioethics and COVID-19 pandemic knowledge. Finally, iOntoBioethics contributes toward setting the first building block for forming the field of “Bioethics Informatics”. © Copyright © 2021 Odeh, Kharbat, Yousef, Odeh, Tbaishat, Hakooz, Dajani and Mansour.","agile framework; bioethics; bioethics informatics; bioethics ontology; COVID-19; design science research methodology; iOntoBioethics; pandemic",,"Odeh, M.; Cancer Care Informatics Programme, Jordan; email: Mohammed.Odeh@sky.com",,"Frontiers Media S.A.",2296858X,,,,"English","Front.

The efficient operation of the traffic light network plays a fundamental role in the search for solutions to achieve an agile, comfortable, safe and sustainable mobility. For this reason, the Municipal Administration has made important investments in its updating and technological modernization that allows actions for a better performance. Currently the traffic lights of the city are operated by classic programming models, mostly at fixed times in different time zones and others in modes actuated and semi-actuated as scheduled, without responding to changing traffic conditions, making it necessary to search for autonomous traffic regulation systems that adapt their behavior according to the conditions. While adaptive systems based on a wide sensorisation for obtaining information online are an alternative, their current costs of implementation, maintenance and operation, has led to evaluate the new global trends in terms of information capture, storage, processing and use in the optimization of the operation of the traffic signal network. This is how the city of Medellin has been consolidating a Big Data storage system and has developed a technological platform capable of receiving it and executing actions on the traffic light system when it identifies that there are events that generate traffic variations different from normal or daily conditions, which has allowed to improve mobility conditions according to the results obtained, which will be detailed later. This first part of this document is an introduction of the different modes of operation of a traffic light network commonly used; the second part contains a brief description of the city’s traffic light network; in the third part, the collaborative data systems are studied; the fourth part develops the solution scheme adopted by Medellin based on the collaborative data system; subsequently the results of the implementation of the system in a specific crossroads of the city are presented; and it ends with some brief conclusions in this regard. © 2018 Institution of Engineering and Technology.

Technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), Cloud, Blockchain, Data Analytics, Big Data, Robotics (autonomous vehicles, drones, RPA), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), Digital Twins, AR/VR has catalyzed this transformation. For instance, the deployment of AI systems to help optimize Bakken Shale wells running on SRP's, implementation of Blockchain drilling for well construction activities, VR/AR visualization of Canada SAGD oilfields, proactive adjustments to ESP using real-time data analytics in Kazakhstan gas condensate wells are some of the recent transformations the industry has witnessed. As the Oil and Gas 4.0 simplifies, modernizing and securing the legacy environments for the new digital era, a robust Digital Assurance is essential. Digital Assurance is an exclusive digital service employing an end-to-end ecosystem approach with intelligent and automated processes to gain quality and speed for promoting faster business, technology change and better customer experience. The service shall offer evaluation of new tools and testing environments such as the cloud, software testing tools, mobile environment, and application performance. Digital Assurance is more than the traditional QA; the evolution of Agile methods with DevOps tools and techniques for software/simulator development and testing has made its deployment quick, safe and reliable. The end-to-end testing process serves to simulate the real user on-field scenarios and validate the system under test and its components for integration and data integrity. Leveraging Digital 2.0 transformations, smart oilfields (by implementing autonomous robots) can eliminate human intervention in potential risk areas and thereby providing a safe, compliant workplace for engineers, managers, crewmembers and other personnel. Especially, robotics has potential applications in inspection, maintenance, and safety operations. In alignment with this, our personalized robotic testing solution can automate various peripheral devices and has resulted in reduced testing cycle time up to 30% and cost by 40%. The solution enables automated end-to-end IoT device interactions spanning smart devices such as camera, thermostat, sensors and web applications in oil and gas facilities. Adding, our various other in-house digital framework and solutions such as Big Data validation framework, cloud-based on-demand testing, and automated test scriptwriters have eased digital transformations. Digital Assurance by rigorous testing practices can also immune oil and gas majors from the cyber threats for the cloud (grid, storage) and blockchain. To overcome such compromises in hardware failure, our smart and innovative IoT Test Workbench solution for integration testing can reduce the hardware dependency up to 100%.

Objective: In this paper, we describe our multidisciplinary efforts with a specific focus on methods to (1) gather community needs, (2) develop interventions, and (3) conduct large-scale agile and rapid community assessments to examine and combat COVID-19 misinformation. Methods: We used the Intervention Mapping framework to perform community needs assessment and develop theory-informed interventions. To supplement these rapid and responsive efforts through large-scale online social listening, we developed a novel methodological framework, comprising qualitative inquiry, computational methods, and quantitative network models to analyze publicly available social media data sets to model content-specific misinformation dynamics and guide content tailoring efforts. As part of community needs assessment, we conducted 11 semistructured interviews, 4 listening sessions, and 3 focus groups with community scientists. Further, we used our data repository with 416,927 COVID-19 social media posts to gather information diffusion patterns through digital channels. Results: Our results from community needs assessment revealed the complex intertwining of personal, cultural, and social influences of misinformation on individual behaviors and engagement. Our social media interventions resulted in limited community engagement and indicated the need for consumer advocacy and influencer recruitment. The linking of theoretical constructs underlying health behaviors to COVID-19–related social media interactions through semantic and syntactic features using our computational models has revealed frequent interaction typologies in factual and misleading COVID-19 posts and indicated significant differences in network metrics such as degree. The performance of our deep learning classifiers was reasonable, with an F-measure of 0.80 for speech acts and 0.81 for behavior constructs. Conclusions: Our study highlights the strengths of community-based field studies and emphasizes the utility of large-scale social media data sets in enabling rapid intervention tailoring to adapt grassroots community interventions to thwart misinformation seeding and spread among minority communities. Implications for consumer advocacy, data governance, and industry incentives are discussed for the sustainable role of social media solutions in public health. © 2023 JMIR Publications Inc.

To scale out the massive metadata access, CephFS adopts a dynamic subtree partitioning method, splitting the hierarchical namespace and distributing subtrees across multiple metadata servers. However, this method suffers from a severe imbalance problem that may result in poor performance due to its inaccurate imbalance prediction, ignorance of workload characteristics, and unnecessary/invalid migration activities. To eliminate these inefficiencies, we propose Lunule, a novel CephFS metadata load balancer, which employs an imbalance factor model for accurately determining when to trigger re-balance and tolerate benign imbalanced situations. Lunule further adopts a workloadaware migration planner to appropriately select subtree migration candidates. Compared to baselines, Lunule achieves better load balance, increases the metadata throughput by up to 315.8%, and shortens the tail job completion time by up to 64.6% for five real-world workloads and their mixture, respectively. Besides, Lunule is capable of handling the metadata cluster expansion and the client workload growth, and scales linearly on a cluster of 16 MDSs. © 2021 IEEE Computer Society.

This paper documents the automation of the back-end in the current wave of digitization. In particular, it highlights the use of technology in streamlining risk management and its potential to provide competitive advantage to the FIs embracing digitization. For instance, automated “big data” credit scoring tools built on predictive analytics and machine learning algorithms are employed to examine several credit propositions. This can accurately construct the credit worthiness and risk profile of public, even without any credit history. These developments can widen the access of credit and other financial services to the society. However, on a cautionary note, this study emphasizes that although digitization of back-end financial transactions carries substantive advantages, the FIs must be guarded against cyber, outsourcing, financial exclusion, and macrofinance risks that can manifest with this automation. In this backdrop, the need for robust yet agile regulations and supervisory counsel to control and exploit the digitization towards optimal benefits for banks and FIs and society at large, acquires salience. Furthermore, regulators and supervisory authorities can mitigate the digitization risks and prevent any public fallout by leveraging the use of digitization itself. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",,,"Chakraborty, G.; Department of Management, India; email: gourab.chakraborty@ifmr.ac.in",,"John Wiley and Sons Ltd",14723891,,,,"English","J.

Within the fourth industrial revolution, pursuing digitalization and on the verge of a leap to Industry 5.0 companies and systems all over the world generate a mass of data. These data have to be collected, analyzed, interpreted, and information derived to take the best business decisions to gain the optimized strategy direction. Due to the large amount of data, analysis for business analysts today is only possible to a limited extent. Therefore, companies need support by Cyber-Physical Systems to group the data, enrich the information, and automate decision-making. In the following paper, the data foundation as an important prerequisite for business decision taking and Artificial Intelligence execution will be researched. Therefore, the required terms are defined and described in theory. Afterward, the data foundation for companies are analyzed by interviews with experts and business representatives as well as field studies.

However, the market is increasingly competitive, with new competitors coming from everywhere. At the same time, the world is changing at a speed never seen before, and the challenges are several: Automatization, scarcity of resources, democratization of the information, big data, and regulation are some examples. Thus, it's not possible for consulting firms to keep providing the market needs without adapting continuously their own business models. The companies that can outperform these challenges more efficiently will win against the competitors. Investigate which strategies and mechanisms adopt to be agile and flexible enough, in which sectors invest the most, and how reinvent their business model in order to be resilient in a fast changing and technological world are the main objectives of this research.

For older people, self-isolation presents particular challenges for mental health and social relationships. As time progresses, continued social distancing could have a compounding impact on these concerns. Objective: This project aims to provide a tool for older people and their families and peers to improve their well-being and health during and after regulated social distancing. First, we will evaluate the tool’s feasibility, acceptability, and usability to encourage positive nutrition, enhance physical activity, and enable virtual interaction while social distancing. Second, we will be implementing the app to provide an online community to assist families and peer groups in maintaining contact with older people using goal setting. Anonymized data from the app will be aggregated with other real-world data sources to develop a machine learning algorithm to improve the identification of patients with COVID-19 and track for real time use by health systems. Methods: Development of this project is occurring at the time of publication, and therefore, a case study design was selected to provide a systematic means of capturing software engineering in progress. The app development framework for software design was based on agile methods. The evaluation of the app’s feasibility, acceptability and usability shall be conducted using Public Health England's guidance on evaluating digital health products, Bandura’s model of health promotion, the Reach Effectiveness Adoption Implementation Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework and the Nonadoption, Abandonment and Challenges to the Scale-up, Spread and Suitability (NASSS) framework. Results: Making use of a pre-existing software framework for health behavior change, a proof of concept was developed, and a multistage app development and deployment for the solution was created. Grant submissions to fund the project and study execution have been sought at the time of publication, and prediscovery iteration of the solution has begun. Ethical approval for a feasibility study design is being sought. Conclusions: This case study lays the foundations for future app development to combat mental and societal issues arising from social distancing measures. The app will be tested and evaluated in future studies to allow continuous improvement of the app. This novel contribution will provide an evidence-based exemplar for future app development in the space of social isolation and loneliness. © Edward Meinert.","Access; Aged; Agile; App; Artificial intelligence; Cellphone; Coronavirus; COVID-19; Data science; Digital health; Evaluation; Exercise; Health care quality; Information science; Mental health; Public reporting of healthcare data; Requirements engineering; Social distancing; Telemedicine",,"Meinert, E.; Digitally Enabled PrevenTative Health Research Group, United Kingdom; email: e.meinert14@imperial.ac.uk",,"JMIR Publications Inc.",23692960,,,,"English","JMIR Publ.

Recently in-network-telemetry (INT) is employed by datacenter transports to perform precise congestion control (CC). Current INT-based CC works well for long flows, however, suffers from serious performance downgrades when BDP-level small flows burst in the first RTT, due to the reason that current INT information from the receivers (host-based INT) needs at least one RTT to respond. In this paper, we make the first attempt to propose an agile and precise congestion control, called APCC, in datacenter networks, working for traffic patterns that is a mix of BDP-level short flows and long flows. APCC explores INT information from switches (switch-based INT) to feedback the congestion information eagerly, and effectively manage BDP-level flows. APCC utilizes the switch-based INT to schedule the complicated and time-varying traffic stably and precisely, and achieve low latency, high bandwidth and network stability simultaneously. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of APCC. The experiment results show that with data centers load containing many BDP-level flows such as Cache Follower and Web Server, switch-based INT shows huge potential of improving the long tail effect on completion time (FCT). APCC reduces tail delay by 21.7%-28.9% under normal circumstances, and can still reduce tail delay by 9.1% under more severe conditions comparing with HPCC. Moreover, APCC shows better convergence. © 2020 IEEE.","Congestion control; Datacenter networks; Host-based INT; In-network telemetry (INT); Switch-based INT","Big data; Cloud computing; Social networking (online); Time varying networks; Completion time; Data center networks; Data centers; High bandwidth; Network stability; Short-lived flow; Time varying; Traffic pattern; Traffic congestion","Dong, D.; National University of Defense TechnologyChina; email: dong@nudt.edu.cn","Hu J.Min G.Georgalas N.Zhao Z.Hao F.Miao W.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781665414852,,,"English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

With this in mind, the purpose of this paper is to present an innovative management model, named E2AB, to measure and analyse reputational intangibles from digital ecosystems and their impacts on tangible assets. Design/methodology/approach: The methodology applied was big data and business intelligence techniques. These methods were used in the computing process to obtain daily data from every asset guarantees that the model is validated with robust data. This model has been corroborated using data from the banking sector, specifically 402,383 net data inputs from the digital ecosystems. Findings: This study illustrates the existence of a holistic influence of intangible assets over tangible assets. The findings demonstrate complex relationships between tangible and intangible assets, determined not only by the type of variable but also by its valence and intensity. Practical implications: These findings may help chief communication officers and general managers a better understanding of how intangible assets extracted from online users’ opinions are related to their organisation’s tangible assets plus a chance to find out about their impact and how to manage them for a practical and agile decision making in real time. Originality/value: It is a pioneering work in establishing a model, which demonstrates transversal and holistic relationships between relational intangible and tangible assets of firms from digital ecosystems, using business intelligence techniques. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Business intelligence; Customer perceptions; Intangible management; Reputational intelligence; Reputational model; Social media data","Competitive intelligence; Decision making; Ecosystems; Information analysis; Agile decision makings; Complex relationships; Customer perceptions; Design/methodology/approach; Digital ecosystem; Intangible assets; Reputational intelligence; Social media datum; Social networking (online)","Casado-Molina, A.-M.; Department of Economics and Business Administration, Spain; email: acasado@uma.es",,"Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.",02635577,,IMDSD,,"English","Ind Manage Data Sys",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075052168

As soon as a task arrives in the cloud or data center that task is assigned to a VM as per the task scheduler and resource allocation policy. Whenever cloud or data center do not have sufficient spare resources over VM to assign a task, a new VM is created over host machine which have spare resource capacity in the cloud and/or data center. The VM creation should be in such a manner that will follow the Service Level Agreement (SLA) to maintain the Quality of Service (QoS) for the client. We have proposed SLA-based agile VM management algorithm to minimize the VM creation time and VM response time. We use ghost VM to increase the efficiency of cloud, allocation of new VM is from the ghost VM, and using the average creation time is reduced up to 11.98%. We propose two algorithms first for Admission control and second for Rescheduling of VM's. Our aim is to reduce the time taken in the rescheduling of the VM. Currently, we are assuming excess VM which are eligible to Garbage Collection do not put overhead over the cloud and they can be handled via background service, and with do not affect foreground services directly and they are handled via the separate management service. © 2019 IEEE.","Cloud computing; cloud efficiency; data-center; VM management","Big data; Cloud computing; Efficiency; Machine learning; Quality of service; Background services; Commodity hardware; Data centers; Garbage collection; Management service; Resource allocation policy; Resource capacity; Service Level Agreements; Virtual machine",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781728102115,,,"English","Proc.

There is a need for a decentralized model to carry out the required substantial amount of computation across edge devices as they has led to the innovation of fog computing. Energy consumption among the edge devices is one of the potential threatening issues in fog computing. Their high energy demand also contributes to higher computation cost. In this paper Double Critic (DC) approach is enforced over the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) technique to design the DC-DDPG framework which formulates high quality energy efficiency policies for fog computing. The performance of the proposed framework is outstanding compared to existing works based on the metrics like energy consumption, response time, total cost, and throughput. They are measured under two different fog computing scenarios i.e., fog layer with multiple entities in a region and fog layer with multiple entities in multiple regions. Mathematical modeling reveals that the energy efficiency policies formulated are of high quality as they satisfy the quality assurance metrics, such as empirical correctness, robustness, model relevance, and data privacy. copy; 2022 IEEE. © 2022 IEEE.","Deterministic Policy Gradient; Double Critic; Energy; Fog computing; Q-learning","Data privacy; Energy efficiency; Energy policy; Energy utilization; Fog; Quality assurance; Reinforcement learning; Deterministic policy gradient; Deterministics; Double critic; Energy; Energy efficiency policies; Energy efficient; Energy-consumption; High quality; Policy gradient; Q-learning; Fog computing",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781665484534,,,"English","IEEE World AI IoT Congr., AIIoT",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85134877807

Generally, an adaptive signal control system fine-tunes signal timing parameters based on pre-defined control hyperparameters using instantaneous traffic detection information. Once traffic pattern changes, those hyperparameters (e.g., maximum and minimum green times) need to be adjusted according to the evolution of traffic dynamics over a very short-term period. Such adjustment processes are usually conducted by professional and experienced traffic engineers. Here we present a human-in-the-loop parallel learning framework and its utilization in an end-to-end recommendation system that mimics and enhances professional signal control engineers' behaviors. The system has been deployed into a real-world application for an extended period in Hangzhou, China, where signal control hyperparameters are recommended based on large-scale multidimensional traffic datasets. Experimental evaluations demonstrate significant improvements in traffic efficiency through the use of our signal recommendation system. © 2000-2011 IEEE.","deep neural networks; Intelligent traffic control; parallel learning; recommendation systems; traffic signal control","Adaptive control systems; Intelligent systems; Internet of things; Large dataset; Learning systems; Man machine systems; Recommender systems; Adaptive signal control systems; Adaptive traffic signal control; Experimental evaluation; Intelligent transportation systems; Internet of Things (IOT); Parallel learning; Traffic efficiency; Urban traffic control; Traffic signals","Guo, H.; College of Information Engineering, China; email: guohf@zjut.edu.cn",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",15249050,,,,"English","IEEE Trans.

It is suggested that this practice, which involves two programmers working collaboratively on the same task and following a prescribed approach, produces high quality code, in shorter timeframes, with increased knowledge-sharing and improved developer productivity. This paper investigates the factors that support, and deter, pair programming adoption in a case study at a s of tware development company in the eThekwini (Durban) region, South Africa. The survey and interviews indicate that the most positive influences are the support from senior and peer staff and the company's willingness to provide the necessary hardware, s of tware and physical layout to enable the use of pair programming. The biggest challenge was the personality mix in a pair, for example introvert/extrovert pairs, where extroverts can dominate pair collaboration.

Specifically, botmasters employ DGAs to dynamically produce a large number of random domains and only register a small subset for their actual C&C servers with the purpose to defend them from takeovers and blacklisting attempts. While many approaches and models have been developed to detect DGA-based botnets, they suffer from several limitations, such as difficulties of DNS traffic collection, low feasibility and scalability, and so forth. In this paper, we present BotCensor, a new system that can determine if a host is infected with certain DGA malware with two-stage anomaly detection. In the first stage, we preliminarily attempt to identify malicious domains using a Markov model, and in the second stage, we re-examine the hosts that requested aforementioned malicious domains using novelty detection algorithms. Our experimental results show that our approach performs very well on identifying previously unknown DGA-generated domains and detects DGA bots with high efficiency and efficacy. Our approach not only can be regarded as security forensics tools, but also can be used to prevent malware infections and spread. © 2018 IEEE.","DGA-based botnet detection; DNS traffic; Markov model; Novelty detection algorithms; Two-stage anomaly detection","Botnet; Command and control systems; Computer crime; Data privacy; Malware; Markov processes; Signal detection; Anomaly detection; Botnet detections; DNS traffics; Markov model; Novelty detection; Big data","Shi, Z.; Institute of Information Engineering, China; email: shizhixin@iie.ac.cn",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781538643877,,,"English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

The Q-Rapids method is based on gathering data from several and heterogeneous sources, to be aggregated into quality-related strategic indicators (e.g., customer satisfaction, product quality) and presented to decision-makers using a highly informative dashboard. The current release of Q-Rapids Tool provides four sets of functionality: (1) data gathering from source tools (e.g. GitLab, Jira, SonarQube, and Jenkins), (2) aggregation of data into three levels of abstraction (metrics, product/process factors, and strategic indicators), (3) visualization of the aggregated data, and (4) navigation through the aggregated data.

Digital transformation boosts information systems-the more robust they are, the easier it is to monitor the health care system in a highly complex state and allow for more agile and reliable analysis. Objective: The purpose of this study was to analyze diagnoses from primary care visits and distinguish between those that had higher and lower variations, relative to the 2019 and 2020 periods (roughly before and during COVID-19), to identify clinical profiles that may have been most impaired from the least-used diagnostic codes for visits during the pandemic. Methods: We used a database from the Primary Care Services Information Technologies Information System of Catalonia. We analyzed the register of visits (n=2,824,185) and their International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) diagnostic codes (n=3,921,974; mean 1.38 per visit), as approximations of the reasons for consultations, at 3 different grouping levels. The data were represented by a term frequency matrix and analyzed recursively in different partitions aggregated according to date. Results: The increase in non-face-to-face visits (+267%) did not counterbalance the decrease in face-to-face visits (-47%), with an overall reduction in the total number of visits of 1.36%, despite the notable increase in nursing visits (10.54%). The largest increases in 2020 were visits with diagnoses related to COVID-19 (ICD-10 codes Z20-Z29: 2.540%), along with codes related to economic and housing problems (ICD-10 codes Z55-Z65: 44.40%). Visits with most of the other diagnostic codes decreased in 2020 relative to those in 2019. The largest reductions were chronic pathologies such as arterial hypertension (ICD-10 codes I10-I16: -32.73%) or diabetes (ICD-10 codes E08-E13: -21.13%), but also obesity (E65-E68: -48.58%) and bodily injuries (ICD-10 code T14: -33.70%). Visits with mental health-related diagnostic codes decreased, but the decrease was less than the average decrease. There was a decrease in consultations-for children, adolescents, and adults-for respiratory infections (ICD-10 codes J00-J06: -40.96%). The results show large year-on-year variations (in absolute terms, an average of 12%), which is representative of the strong shock to the health system. Conclusions: The disruption in the primary care model in Catalonia has led to an explosive increase in the number of non-face-to-face visits. There has been a reduction in the number of visits for diagnoses related to chronic pathologies, respiratory infections, obesity, and bodily injuries. Instead, visits for diagnoses related to socioeconomic and housing problems have increased, which emphasizes the importance of social determinants of health in the context of this pandemic. Big data analytics with routine care data yield findings that are consistent with those derived from intuition in everyday clinical practice and can help inform decision making by health planners in order to use the next few years to focus on the least-treated diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2021 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

Seattle Children's Healthcare System (Seattle Children's) is an example of an organization that has built an operating model that integrates analytics into their business and daily operations. We present a roadmap for how Seattle Children's consolidated its fragmented analytics operations into a unified cohesive ecosystem capable of supporting advanced analytics capabilities and operational integration to transform care and accelerate research. Methods: In-depth interviews were conducted with ten leaders at Seattle Children's who have been instrumental in developing their enterprise analytics program. Interviews included the following leadership roles: Chief Data & Analytics Officer, Director of Research Informatics, Principal Systems Architect, Manager of Bioinformatics and High Throughput Analytics, Director of Neurocritical Care, Strategic Program Manager & Neuron Product Development Lead, Director of Dev Ops,Director of Clinical Analytics, Data Science Manager, and Advance Analytics Product Engineer. The interviews were unstructured and consisted of conversations intended to gather information from leadership about their experiences in building out Enterprise Analytics at Seattle Children's. Results: Seattle Children's has built an advanced enterprise analytics ecosystem that is integrated into its daily operations by applying an entrepreneurial mindset and agile development practices that are common in a startup environment. Analytics efforts were approached iteratively by selecting high-value projects that were delivered through Multidisciplinary Delivery Teams that were integrated into service lines. Service line leadership, in partnership with the Delivery Team leads, were responsible for the success of the team by setting project priorities, determining project budgets, and maintaining overall governance of their analytics endeavors. This organizational structure has led to the development of a wide range of analytic products that have been used to improve both operations and clinical care at Seattle Children's. Conclusions: Seattle Children's has demonstrated how a leading healthcare system can successfully create a robust, scalable, near real-time analytics ecosystem- one that delivers significant value to the organization from the ever-expanding volume of health data we see today. © 2022 The Authors.

Recently cloud is being used by organizations to save time, money and efforts required to setup and maintain infrastructure and platform. Continuous Integration and Delivery is in practice nowadays within Agile methodology to give capability of multiple software releases on daily basis and ensuring all the development, test and Production environments could be synched up quickly. In such an agile environment there is need to ramp up testing tools and processes so that overall regression testing including functional, performance and security testing could be done along with build deployments at real time. To support this phenomenon, we researched on Continuous Testing and worked with industry professionals who are involved in architecting, developing and testing the software products. A lot of research has been done towards automating software testing so that testing of software product could be done quickly and overall testing process could be optimized. As part of this paper we have proposed ACT TestBot tool, metrics dashboard and coined 4S quality metrics term to quantify quality of the software product. ACT testbot and metrics dashboard will be integrated with Continuous Integration tools, Bug reporting tools, test management tools and Data Analytics tools to trigger automation scripts, continuously analyze application logs, open defects automatically and generate metrics reports. Defect pattern report will be created to support root cause analysis and to take preventive action. © 2019 IEEE.","4S Quality Metrics; ACT (Automated Continuous Testing); Auto Bug Logging and Tracking; Cloud; Continuous Delivery; Continuous Deployment; Continuous Integration; Continuous Testing; T-Model; TestBot; XaaS (Everything as a Service)","Automation; Big data; Clouds; Data Analytics; Defects; Information management; Integration; Machine learning; Continuous Delivery; Continuous Deployment; Continuous integrations; Continuous testing; Quality metrics; T-model; TestBot; XaaS (Everything as a Service); Integration testing",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781728102115,,,"English","Proc.

Industry 4.0 (I4.0), in turn, has recently emerged in the manufacturing sector, highlighting digitalization and its incorporation in industrial processes, ensuring improvements in production lines. This work intended to analyze the LM and I4.0 integration by studying the relationship between the classic types of waste with the digital technologies 4.0. Applying a three-phase methodology approach, the principles, attributes, and technologies of LM and I4.0 were identified. A relationship matrix and multidimensional diagrams were designed to investigate how digital technologies can contribute to the reduction of LM waste. A total of 27 associations were established and the emergent technologies with more combinations referred to Automated Guided Vehicles, Big Data Analytics, and Additive Manufacturing. Consequently, LM and I4.0 can work together and provide benefits to each other, highlighting that technologies 4.0 are critical to support waste reduction in manufacturing companies.

In this context, the concept of smart cities is discussed. An enabling element of the smart city concept is applying information technology (IT) to improve administrative efficiency and quality of life while reducing costs and resource consumption and ensuring greater citizen participation in administrative and urban development issues. While these smart city services are technologically studied and implemented, government officials, citizens or businesses are often unaware of the large variety of smart city service solutions. Therefore, this work deals with developing a smart city services catalogue that documents best practice services to create a platform that brings citizens, city government, and businesses together. Although the concept of IT service catalogues is not new and guidelines and recommendations for the design and development of service catalogues already exist in the corporate context, there is little work on smart city service catalogues.

In this paper we present the Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) based techniques being used for the refactoring and the expansion of the e-learning application ""Cyber Trainer"", in particular for specific ad-hoc modules focused on properly filtering and analyzing data. The MAS architecture is based on a set of different ""agents"", i.e., always running programs that can communicate with each other and work together in order to achieve their tasks. In this project, we used a novel hybrid approach blending MAS programming with Object and Event Programming techniques, taking the best from each one, to manage asynchronous events, communication between different modules, and data flows that need to be treated as big data. The Cyber Trainer ""Reporting MAS""design has been focused on scalability, modularity, resistance to change and security. This last point, generally important for every real-world application, in our case is particularly crucial, since Cyber Trainer is distributed over many servers (Reporting MAS Server module agents themself can run on several machines as well). © 14th IADIS International Conf.

Although SDN architecture provides manifold benefits but on the same time its dependence on a logically centralized controller lead to the single point of failure. An attacker can easily capture the any forwarding device and restrict the availability of the controller using different prevalent attacks. Distributed denial of service (DDoS) is one of the most popular attack of this category which is quiet prevalent in SDN. Here, the aim of the attackers is to inject false script in the open flow tables through malicious switches which multiply exponentially. Therefore, in this paper, a blockchain as a service framework has been presented wherein BlockSDSec model is designed to provide security as a separate service for the SDN architecture. This work provides a mechanism to prevent the threats of DDoS at the switch level by embedding an security using blockchain onto the interaction channels of data and control planes. The load balancing at the controller level is achieved using a virtual controller. The proposed scheme is simulated using MiniNet Emulator to analyze the delay originating from usage of blockchain. © 2019 IEEE.","Blockchain; Distributed denial of service; Malicious switch; MiniNet; Software defined networks","Big data; Blockchain; Controllers; Network architecture; Network security; Software defined networking; Centralized controllers; Distributed denial of service; Interaction channel; MiniNet; Network technologies; Service framework; Software defined networking (SDN); Virtual controller; Denial-of-service attack",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781728130248,,,"English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

Despite this disruption, proponents of open data collaboration have argued that some of the biggest problems of the 21st century need to be solved with the help of many people and that data sharing will be the necessary engine to make that happen. In the United States, a national strategic plan for data sharing encouraged the federally funded scientific agencies to (a) publish open data for community use in discoverable, machinereadable, and useful ways; (b) work with public and civil society organizations to set priorities for data to be shared; (c) support innovation and feedback on open data solutions; and (d) continue efforts to release and enhance high-priority data sets funded by taxpayer dollars. One of the more visible open data projects in the psychological sciences is the presidentially announced ""Brain Research Through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies"" (BRAIN) initiative. Lessons learned from initiatives such as these are instructive both from the perspective of open science within psychology and from the perspective of understanding the psychology of open science. Recommendations for creating better pathways to ""walk the walk"" in open science include (a) nurturing innovation and agile learning, (b) thinking outside the paradigm, (c) creating simplicity from complexity, and (d) participating in continuous learning evidence platforms. © 2018 American Psychological Association.","Big data; Culture of science; Data sharing; Open science","human; information dissemination; procedures; psychology; research; Humans; Information Dissemination; Psychology; Research","Hesse, B.W.; Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences, 9609 Medical Center Drive, MSC 9761, United States; email: hesseb@mail.nih.gov",,"American Psychological Association Inc.",0003066X,,AMPSA,"29481106","English","Am.

Candidate frameworks must also address key mission areas while enabling partnerships with the private sector, academia, and global allies. To meet these challenges, a flexible, cost-effective, and scalable computing infrastructure that incorporates cutting edge technologies and complies with stringent information assurance requirements is necessary. The DoD AI strategy mandates the agile employment of innovative AI capabilities that 'rapidly and iteratively' execute experimentation with new operating concepts, and leverage lessons learned in subsequent experiments. Using cloud computing, we present a flexible approach to solve complex systems problems. Promoting 'rapid experimentation' and collaboration on problems such as recursive algorithm implementation, deep learning, and inference in neural networks has enabled inherent advantages over existing computing frameworks.

The fast progress in this field poses the need to define new approaches and methods to support an agile and structured assessment process. Method: The assessment of key information, characteristics and challenges deriving from the application of ML tools in CTs and their link with the principles for a trustworthy artificial intelligence (AI) that directly affect the decision-making process is investigated. Results: Potential issues are identified during the assessment and areas of greater interaction combining key regulatory points and principles for a trustworthy AI are highlighted. The most impacted areas are those related to technical robustness and safety of the ML tool, in relation to data used and the level of evidence generated. Additional areas of attention emerged, like the ones related to data and algorithm transparency. Conclusion: We evaluate the applicability of a new method to further support the assessment of medicinal products developed using data-driven tools in a CT setting. This is a first step and new paradigms should be adopted to support policy makers and regulatory decisions, capitalizing on technology advancements, considering stakeholders’ feedback and still ensuring a regulatory framework on safety and efficacy.

With the advent of the Big Data, infoxication is affecting critical domains such as Health Sciences, where tough decisions for patient's health is being taken every day based on heterogeneous, unconnected and sometimes conflicting information. In order to understand the magnitude of the challenge, based on the information publicly available about the genetic causes of the disease and using data quality assessment techniques, we performed an exhaustive analysis of the DNA variations that have been associated to the risk of suffering migraine headache. The same analysis has been repeated 8 months after, and the results have allowed us to exemplify i) how fragile is the information in this domain, ii) the difficulty of finding repositories of contrasted and reliable data, and iii) the need to have information systems that, far from integrating and storing huge volumes of data, are able to support the decision-making process by providing mechanisms agile and flexible enough to be able to adapt to the changing user needs. © 2019 IEEE.","Genomics; Information Systems; Infoxication; SILE method","Data acquisition; Decision making; Genes; Information use; Quality control; Risk assessment; Critical domain; Data quality assessment; Decision making process; Genomics; Information overloads; Infoxication; Making decision; SILE method; Information systems",,"Kolp M.Vanderdonckt J.Snoeck M.Wautelet Y.","IEEE Computer Society",21511349,9781728148441,,,"English","Proc.

For that reason, supply chain managers need to shift their attention from cutting costs to enabling new processes, and make corporations more connected and agile to create value across the enterprise. New digital technologies that are emerging everyday are on their way to disrupt nearly all the areas of traditional business processes. The key business priority of almost every industry will find itself in the centre of this upcoming digital era. The process of digitization affects almost everything in today's organizations, including supply chain management and puts huge pressure on organizations to change. Hence it is crucial for managers to understand the implication of digitization on their organization and employees. Current scenario emphasises on the importance of management of people and organization issues in digital transformations. The effect of digitization includes varied impacts on economy as a whole; create tremendous opportunities and challenges for businesses. In the current world of globalization digitization is not a choice but an imperative for all businesses across all industries. Manufacturing processes and work, business model, products and services are the main targets of digitization. The digital transformation enablers and framework discussed in this study-comprised of six techniques of Big data, Cloud services, Unique identification and display innovation, Robotics, Sensors and geolocation, and nanotech and 3D printing-can serve as enablers of digitization. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"3D printers; Human resource management; Managers; Metadata; Business modeling; Digital supply chain; Digital technologies; Digital transformation; Global supply chain; Manufacturing process; Products and services; Unique identifications; Supply chain management",,"Gupta M.S.N.","Institute of Physics Publishing",17578981,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

This paper investigates the potential interventions and disruptive impacts that Industry 4.0 technologies may have on pharmaceutical Circular SCs (CSCs). To accomplish this, a novel method involving a literature review and Pythagorean fuzzy-Delphi has initially been employed to identify and screen categorized lists of Industry 4.0 Disruptive Technologies (IDTs) and their impacts on pharmaceutical CSC. Subsequently, the weight of finalized impacts and the performance score of finalized IDTs have simultaneously been measured via a novel version of Pythagorean fuzzy SECA (Simultaneously Evaluation of Criteria and Alternatives). Then, the priority of each intervention for disruptive impacts of Industry 4.0 has been determined via the Hanlon method. This is one of the first papers to provide in-depth insights into advancing the study of the disruptive action of Industry 4.0 technologies cross-fertilizing CE throughout pharmaceutical SCs in the emerging economy of Iran. The results indicate that digital technologies such as Big Data Analytics, Global Positioning Systems, Enterprise Resource Planning, and Digital Platforms are quite available in the Irans' pharmaceutical industry. These technologies, along with four available interventions, e.g., environmental regulations, subsidy, fine, and reward, would facilitate moving towards a lean, agile, resilient, and sustainable supply chain through the efficient utilization of resources, optimized waste management, and substituting the human workforce by machines. © 2022 The Author(s)","Hanlon method; Industry 4.0 technologies; Pythagorean fuzzy Delphi; Pythagorean fuzzy SECA","Data Analytics; Enterprise resource planning; Environmental regulations; Environmental technology; Industry 4.0; Sulfur compounds; Sustainable development; Waste management; Disruptive technology; Emerging economies; Environmental concerns; Fuzzy Delphi; Hanlon method; Industry 4.0 technology; Novel methods; Pythagorean fuzzy delphi; Pythagorean fuzzy simultaneously evaluation of criteria and alternative; Societal concerns; Supply chains","Amoozad Mahdiraji, H.; School of Business, United Kingdom; email: Ham26@leicester.ac.uk",,"Elsevier Ltd",03608352,,CINDD,,"English","Comput Ind Eng",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85140486674

Although some technologies may have very specific applications, there are others much more open. The Shipbuilding Industry is quite traditional, however there are many advantages if the Industry 4.0 technologies could be applied from the beginning of the ship design to autonomous shipping. CAD/CAM tools are used to manage many data that must be considered in advance for the further stages of the ship lifecycle. Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality and Mixed Reality are closely related to the Digital Twin and interlaced with Big Data, which are generated by CAD tools and all surrounding solutions, which applies some cloud/edge/fog computing to these data in a merged technology between finite-state machines and Artificial Intelligence cognitive processes. To perform all these integrations in an agile manner requires a network which support different connections to add specific devices, i.e. Internet of the Things, which can access to the data, creating and modifying them, in a different layer which affects to the basic information layer created by the CAD/PLM tools in the shipyard and later on being used by the autonomous ships. This network should be secure, but also open to allow distributed work, which must be tracked such that all design or process modifications are recorded an open, transparent, trusted and non-modifiable working method for all stakeholders, like shipyard, engineering offices, classification society and ship owner.

Interaktion. Organisation. (GIO) addresses changes in leadership through digitalization and their consequences for leaders. For years, digitalization has been heralding changes such as increasing leadership at a distance or use of digital communication media. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) now face the task of coping with these changes and have to contend with major uncertainties: What are major determining trends for leaders in SMEs? Which changes will shape leadership and how will they change leadership tasks and success-critical behavior? In semi-structured interviews with seven experts from SMEs we have explored these questions. Trends expected by the experts describe changes in the organizational structures and in work within the company. Structurally, companies will become more agile and diverse, hierarchies will play a less strong role and companies will cooperate more closely with each other. Work will become more location-independent, more influenced by Big Data and many tasks will be made easier or taken over by technology. In relation to established models of leadership tasks and behavior, the experts see a clear shift in tasks in favor of managing human resources, including the development of employees through coaching and the transfer of responsibility. In addition to previous tasks, the experts see managing change as a new task area. This area consists of accompanying change, acting flexibly and agilely, communicating openly and transparently and allowing failure. With regard to changes in success-critical behavior, leaders have to show more strategy orientation, communicate clearly and be open to new ideas and further development. © 2021, The Author(s).","Digitalization; Leadership; Leadership behavior; Skills; Tasks",,"Masjutin, L.; Department of Psychology, Universitätsstraße 25, Germany; email: masjutin@uni-bielefeld.de",,"Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH",23666145,,,,"English","Gruppe.

Support vector machine (SVM) is one such ML technique that has been used in object detection, image classification, text categorization and Pattern Recognition. However, training even a simple SVM model on big data takes a significant amount of computational time. Due to this, the model is unable to react and adapt in real-time. There is an urgent need to speedup the training process. Since organizations typically use the cloud for this data processing, accelerating the training process has the advantage of bringing down costs. In this paper, we propose a model partitioning approach that partitions the tasks of Stochastic Gradient Descent based Support Vector Machines (SGD-SVM) on various edge devices for concurrent computation, thus reducing the training time significantly. The proposed partitioning mechanism not only brings down the training time but also maintains the approximate accuracy over the centralized cloud approach. With a goal of developing a smart objection detection system, we conduct experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed method using SGD-SVM on an edge based architecture. The results illustrate that the proposed approach significantly reduces the training time by 47%, while decreasing the accuracy by 2%, and offering an optimal number of partitions. © 2021 IEEE.","edge computing; partitioning; SGD-SVM","Computer architecture; Data handling; Edge computing; Gradient methods; Image classification; Object detection; Object recognition; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Text processing; EDGE architectures; Edge computing; Machine learning techniques; Partitioning; Stochastic gradient descent; Stochastic gradient descent based support vector machine; Support vector machine models; Support vectors machine; Training process; Training time; Support vector machines",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781665412520,,,"English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

To date, some studies have presented healthcare systems for specific purposes without an explicit approach for the development of health services. Moreover, software engineering is hindered by agile management challenges regarding development and deployment processes of new applications. This paper presents an approach to develop health Internet of Things (IoT) reactive applications that can be widely used in smart cities for the care of elderly individuals. The proposed approach is based on the Rozanski and Woods’s iterative architectural design process, the use of architectural patterns, and the Reactive Manifesto Principles. Furthermore, domain-driven design and the characteristics of the emerging fast data architecture are used to adapt the functionalities of services around the IoT, big data, and cloud computing paradigms. In addition, development and deployment processes are proposed as a set of tasks through DevOps techniques. The approach validation was carried out through the implementation of several e-health services, and various workload experiments were performed to measure scalability and performance in certain parts of the architecture. The system obtained is flexible, scalable, and capable of handling the data flow in near real time. Such features are useful for users who work collaboratively in the care of elderly people. With the accomplishment of these results, one can envision using this approach for building other e-health services. © 2021 by the author.

Design/methodology/approach: A living-lab methodology was adopted for this paper as an innovative approach, in which technologies that are in the development stages or full deployments are integrated with social research design to test the viability of such technologies for the intended purposes. Findings: The LIS alignment of virtual learning technologies showed that disruptive technology could benefit academic libraries, with minimum training of staff. However, internet bandwidth, digital divide and lack of built-in functionality on the Zoom, compared with Moodle, for assessment and grading are huge setbacks. Nevertheless, library platforms must be mobile-response and agile software algorithm to include voice-over and voice recognition search functionality to access all the databases. Research limitations/implications: For this paper, use of disruptive technology was limited to virtual online learning, Zoom and Moodle; however, the alignment of blockchain and big data and the libraries services was not covered. Practical implications: This paper showed that the LIS could mitigate the COVID-19 global pandemic with disruptive IT alignment with learning management systems (LMS) and for the libraries to remain open during the coronavirus lockdown. Social implications: Academic libraries can deploy disruptive technologies as virtual library spaces. Originality/value: Disruptive technology alignment with LMS as virtual library space was posited for the academic librarians to mitigate the effect of COVID-19 pandemic. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Academic librarian; Disruptive technology; Library; LIS; Virtual learning",,"Ajibade, P.; Department of Information Studies Programme, South Africa; email: ajibadep.sa@gmail.com",,"Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.",07419058,,,,"English","Libr.

Designed for well-perimetrised environments, these methods rely on a systematic identification of threats and vulnerabilities to identify efficient control-centered protection countermeasures. Unfortunately, this does not fit security challenges carried out by the opened and agile organizations provided by the Social, Mobile, big data Analytics, Cloud and Internet of Things (SMACIT) environment. Due to their inherently collaborative and distributed organization, such multi-tenancy systems require the integration of contextual vulnerabilities, depending on the a priori unknown way of using, storing and exchanging data in opened cloud environment. Moreover, as data can be associated to multiple copies, different protection requirements can be set for each of these copies, which may lead the initial data owner lose control on the data protection. This involves (1) turning the traditional control-centered security vision to a dynamic data-centered protection and even (2) considering that the way a data is used can be a potential threat that may corrupt data protection efficiency. To fit these challenges, we propose a Data-centric Usage-based Protection service (DUP). This service is based on an information system meta-model, used to identify formally data assets and store the processes using copies of these assets. To define a usage-entered protection, we extend the Usage Based Access Control model, which is mostly focused on managing CRUD operations, to more complex operation fitting the SMACIT context. These usage rules are used to generate smart contracts, storing usage consents and managing usage control for cloud services. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Blockchain; Data-driven organization; GDPR; Privacy; Usage governance","Advanced Analytics; Data Analytics; Information systems; Information use; Privacy by design; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Access control models; Distributed organizations; Protection countermeasures; Protection efficiency; Protection requirements; Security risk analysis; Systematic identification; Threats and vulnerabilities; Access control","Biennier, F.; University of Lyon, France; email: frederique.biennier@liris.cnrs.fr","Hacid H.Outay F.Paik H.Alloum A.Petrocchi M.Bouadjenek M.R.Beheshti A.Liu X.Maaradji A.","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH",03029743,9783030763510,,,"English","Lect.

There is a need to address such failures in advance, through the use of prevailing information technological inclusion, implicating efficient operations benefiting the entire sector. With Knowledge Management Systems evolving at its growing needs to address critical issues and providing feasible solutions to the digitization of information already at high demand, we propose an analytical approach merged with the concepts of big data, to track historical data of assets and resources, to identify the possibilities of failure of assets in smart power grid infrastructure. The proposed system would identify the possible failure based on the past records of an assets performance and failures, not limited to, but also based on the expected life span of the assets. The issues will be archived for further sharing while in apposite needs and its solutions would be appropriately applied throughout the power business and its subsidiary. The data would be efficiently stored and archived in the form of digitized formats such as audio, video, images, comments, documents, feedback and other visually recognizable and multimedia formats.

Prevalently adopted by these systems for task deployments of diverse workloads such as big data, web services, and IoT, they support agile application deployment, environmental consistency, OS distribution portability, application-centric management, and resource isolation. Although most of these systems are mature with advanced features, their optimization strategies are still tailored to the assumption of a static cluster. Elastic compute resources would enable heterogeneous resource management strategies in response to the dynamic business volume for various types of workloads. Hence, we propose a heterogeneous task allocation strategy for cost-efficient container orchestration through resource utilization optimization and elastic instance pricing with three main features. The first one is to support heterogeneous job configurations to optimize the initial placement of containers into existing resources by task packing. The second one is cluster size adjustment to meet the changing workload through autoscaling algorithms. The third one is a rescheduling mechanism to shut down underutilized VM instances for cost saving and reallocate the relevant jobs without losing task progress. We evaluate our approach in terms of cost and performance on the Australian National Cloud Infrastructure (Nectar). Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed strategy could reduce the overall cost by 23% to 32% for different types of cloud workload patterns when compared to the default Kubernetes framework. © 2020 ACM.","Cluster management; container orchestration; cost efficiency; resource heterogeneity","Cloud computing; Containers; Costs; Web services; Application deployment; Cloud computing infrastructures; Cloud infrastructures; Cluster management system; Heterogeneous resources; Lightweight application; Optimization strategy; Resource utilizations; Information management","Zhong, Z.; University of Melbourne, Australia; email: zhiheng@student.unimelb.edu.au",,"Association for Computing Machinery",15335399,,,,"English","ACM Trans.

The key to success in coping with this change, which can be seen in all industries, is to break up old structures and venture something new. The ability to adapt and innovate is becoming a central success-critical factor in entrepreneurial activity. In order to continue to achieve market success and ensure sustainable growth in an extremely dynamic and disruptive environment, enterprises and organisations are called upon to proactively shape change. In addition to the establishment of flexible working models and agile processes, the increased generation and integration of knowledge into and around technical systems in the course of targeted competence development of employees is indispensable. The introduction and use of technical systems thus must go hand in hand with the flexibilisation of innovation and collaboration processes as well as the development of employee skills in order to generate the currently missing socio-technological link - for companieś added value and for the benefit of people. In this paper, the authors present an overview of currently used creativity techniques and innovation methods and work out the promising potentials as well as basic restrictions of the respective tools.

These data can be used to monitor, detect and anticipate different kinds of infrastructure vulnerabilities and anomalies, as well as to implement more personalized services that could improve citizens' life. In this new context, full of opportunities, it is difficult to foresee and develop, in advance, the set of applications and services that can be potentially useful for administrators and citizens to solve the manifold compelling needs a city may have to face.

Production control in petrochemical industry involves complex circumstances and a high demand for timeliness; therefore, agile and smart controls are important components of intelligent manufacturing in the petrochemical industry. This paper proposes a framework and approaches for constructing a digital twin based on the petrochemical industrial IoT, machine learning and a practice loop for information exchange between the physical factory and a virtual digital twin model to realize production control optimization. Unlike traditional production control approaches, this novel approach integrates machine learning and real-time industrial big data to train and optimize digital twin models. It can support petrochemical and other process manufacturing industries to dynamically adapt to the changing environment, respond in a timely manner to changes in the market due to production optimization, and improve economic benefits. Accounting for environmental characteristics, this paper provides concrete solutions for machine learning difficulties in the petrochemical industry, e.g., high data dimensions, time lags and alignment between time series data, and high demand for immediacy. The approaches were evaluated by applying them in the production unit of a petrochemical factory, and a model was trained via industrial IoT data and used to realize intelligent production control based on real-time data. A case study shows the effectiveness of this approach in the petrochemical industry. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","digital twin; internet of things; machine learning; petrochemical industry; production control optimization","Data mining; E-learning; Engineering education; Internet of things; Learning systems; Machine learning; Manufacture; Metadata; Petrochemical plants; Production control; Control optimization; digital twin; Environmental characteristic; Intelligent Manufacturing; Intelligent production control; Machine learning technology; Petrochemical industry; Process manufacturing industries; Petrochemicals","Liu, Z.; School of Economics and Management, China; email: leoliuzy@dlut.edu.cn",,"Elsevier Ltd",02684012,,IJMAE,,"English","Int J Inf Manage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066307148

Upcoming 5G systems are evolving to support exploding mobile traffic volumes, real-time extraction of fine-grained analytics, and agile management of network resources, so as to maximize user experience. Fulfilling these tasks is challenging, as mobile environments are increasingly complex, heterogeneous, and evolving. One potential solution is to resort to advanced machine learning techniques, in order to help manage the rise in data volumes and algorithm-driven applications. The recent success of deep learning underpins new and powerful tools that tackle problems in this space. In this paper, we bridge the gap between deep learning and mobile and wireless networking research, by presenting a comprehensive survey of the crossovers between the two areas. We first briefly introduce essential background and state-of-the-art in deep learning techniques with potential applications to networking. We then discuss several techniques and platforms that facilitate the efficient deployment of deep learning onto mobile systems. Subsequently, we provide an encyclopedic review of mobile and wireless networking research based on deep learning, which we categorize by different domains. Drawing from our experience, we discuss how to tailor deep learning to mobile environments.

This defines the strategical context for composing resilient enterprise architectures for micro-granular digital services and products. The change from a closed-world modeling perspective to more flexible open-world composition and evolution of system architectures defines the moving context for adaptable systems, which are essential to enable the digital transformation. Enterprises are presently transforming their strategy and culture together with their processes and information systems to become more digital. The digital transformation deeply disrupts existing enterprises and economies. Since years a lot of new business opportunities appeared using the potential of the Internet and related digital technologies, like Internet of Things, services computing, cloud computing, big data with analytics, mobile systems, collaboration networks, and cyber physical systems. Digitization fosters the development of IT systems with many rather small and distributed structures, like Internet of Things or mobile systems. In this paper, we are focusing on the continuous bottom-up integration of micro-granular architectures for a huge amount of dynamically growing systems and services, like Internet of Things and Microservices, as part of a new digital enterprise architecture. To integrate micro-granular architecture models to living architectural model versions we are extending more traditional enterprise architecture reference models with state of art elements for agile architectural engineering to support the digitalization of services with related products, and their processes. © Designing Digitalization, ISD 2018.

Brain banks have been operationally diverse, collecting primarily end stage disease, with variable quality clinical data available, yet it is now recognized the most informative brain donations are from those in longitudinally studied cohorts. The Brains for Dementia Research (BDR) cohort and program was for planned brain donation across five UK brain banks and one donation point, with standardized operating procedures, following longitudinal clinical and psychometric assessments for people with no cognitive impairment as well as those with dementia. Lay representatives with experience of dementia were involved from inception of BDR and 74.5% of all enquiries about participation came through routes that were directly attributable to or influenced by lay representatives. Ten years after inception, this ongoing project has received over 700 brain donations from the recruited cohort of 3,276 potential brain donors. At cohort census for this paper, 72.2% of the living cohort have no cognitive impairment by assessment, whereas only 28.3% of the donated cohort were without cognitive impairment. It is important that brain banks are agile and reflect the changing needs of the research community, given that 'big data', readiness cohorts, and GWAS demand large sample numbers of highly characterized individuals to facilitate new approaches and understanding of pathological processes in dementia. © 2018 - IOS Press and the authors.

While the mathematics behind AI has existed for decades, its rapid adoption in virtually all sectors has been powered by open source, where a global community of academicians and data scientists are continuously developing and improving the mathematics behind the predictive and prescriptive solutions of the future. We posit that the existence of AI software development, which we describe as data driven analytical solutions providing predictive and prescriptive answers to questions, is solely due to the academia's focus on research and its pedagogical goals driving the dissemination of the research to the open source community to move the research to development. Indeed, all data science coursework is steeped in training on open source platforms and tools. When models do not depend on platforms, organizations can deploy flexible and agile software that has the ability to leverage better methods that come out in the future. Borrowing ideas from other industries we can see that just as Wordpress and its open source community of designers and developers revolutionized how websites are created, software that can quickly deploy the best available technology (and be mobile) while maintaining the security of the data is poised for user adoption and success where legacy systems and traditional dashboards fail. While the mathematics of physics does not change our confidence in its accuracy, in comparison, the mathematics of an AI algorithm is an approximation. This mathematics is being continuously improved though rarely achieving 100% accuracy. Algorithms are built upon open source AI libraries that are continuously improving. Similarly, the methods and techniques for developing the AI algorithms in oil and gas are continuously improving through two main sources, academia and adjacent industries reapplication of AI methods. We provide examples of open source technologies already part and parcel of all data scientists' repertoire of development, who are currently working in oil and gas.

This pandemic has shown that future living will need to be agile and flexible to adapt to the various changes in needs of societal populations. Digital technology has played an integral role during COVID-19, assisting various sectors of the community, and demonstrating that smart cities can provide opportunities to respond to many future societal challenges. In the decades ahead, the rise in aging populations will be one of these challenges, and one in which the needs and requirements between demographic cohorts will vary greatly. Although we need to create future smart age-friendly ecosystems to meet these needs, technology still does not feature in the WHO eight domains of an age-friendly city. This paper extends upon Marston and van Hoof’s ‘Smart Age-friendly Ecosystem’ (SAfE) framework, and explores how digital technology, design hacking, and research approaches can be used to understand a smart age-friendly ecosystem in a post-pandemic society. By exploring a series of case studies and using real-life scenarios from the standpoint of COVID-19, we propose the ‘Concept of Age-friendly Smart Ecologies (CASE)’ framework. We provide an insight into a myriad of contemporary multi-disciplinary research, which are capable to initiate discussions and bring various actors together with a positive impact on future planning and development of age-friendly ecosystems. The strengths and limitations of this framework are outlined, with advantages evident in the opportunity for towns, regions/counties, provinces, and states to take an agile approach and work together in adopting and implement improvements for the greater benefits of residents and citizens. © 2020 by the authors.

Third, as a communication support method for the interface of the inspection equipment, stability and various technologies were secured through a number of communication tests and certification tests such as RS232C, TCP/IP, and Serial HL7. Fourth, through multiple database tests (Oracle, MSSQL, MySQL, MS Access, etc.), cost savings were secured by resolving duplicate investment by providing database neutrality and interface with other systems. Fifth, utility and user satisfaction were enhanced by providing program functions for outputting the result report in various formats and configuring the UI settings, and the UI settings were modularized to reduce the program development costs and allow the modules to be reused. Through the results of research, small and medium hospitals can improve the reliability of inspection results through the machine learning-based quality control module, and through real-time monitoring of the inspection equipment, it is possible to quickly determine whether there is a failure and improve the operation rate of the inspection equipment. In addition, by providing a module that can be linked with the existing information system, it was made easy to link, and the convenience of the user was improved by providing various UI environments.

The unique reservoir modeling challenges and novelty of the data science methods will be presented, along with preliminary results and lessons learnt. One of the most important elements in reservoir characterization and history matching process is integration between static and dynamic modeling. With numerous layers as study perimeter, a large number of uncertain parameters is unavoidable, from dynamic uncertainties such as hydrocarbon contacts and communication between regions to static properties like porosity, water saturation, etc. These in turn will create hundreds of possible scenarios during History Matching. Using python scripting embedded in the reservoir simulator and the agile reservoir modeling (ARM) approach, these uncertainties can be handled quickly, and each ensemble can be analyzed easily with Data Analytics and Machine Learning based proxy approaches. The case study presented here is a giant mature oilfield with more than 50 zones and 100 contact regions. With more than 45 years of production and injection history, the conventional reservoir modeling where each zone is modeled individually and independently, assuming no communication between the regions, has been deemed as taking too much time and effort. The integrated approach bypasses this challenge by allowing simultaneous reservoir modeling as well as quick sensitivity analysis and history matching quality checking. Uncertainties were managed early on; for instance, the porosity model was generated through available algorithms and hydrocarbon contacts with Latin-hypercube sampling method. Preliminary results showed that overall time required to perform the modeling has been reduced significantly, while also establishing communication between the regions. Analytical aquifer modeling and communication between the regions were observed as the most sensitive parameters especially when matching the pressure behavior. Moreover, embedded python script and Data Analytics Dashboard have made it possible to perform fast and systematic analysis, thus more effort and time can be allocated to plan the way forward. The Machine Learning results will be further finalized at the next gate review, considering the project was initially proposed into several gates. Static modeling using Machine Learning, coupled with dynamic modeling workflow and data analytics, has created a complete loop of reservoir study and characterization. All of these are conducted in a structured cloud-based platform, ensuring time-efficient process and repeatability while at the same time enabling hybrid approach by combining conventional method and advanced data driven approach.

According to EU policy, these transformations are related to educational reforms and the introduction of new technology and methodologies in teaching and learning. They are expected to answer to the PISA requirements and to increase the DESI (Digital Economy and Society Index). They are also likely to mitigate the inequity of HEIs (higher education institutions), empowered by a structured, goal-oriented strategy towards agile management in HEIs that is also appropriate for new market demands. Our study is based on an exploratory survey applied to 139 Romanian and Serbian teachers from the Information Technology School—ITS, Belgrade, and Spiru Haret University, Romania. The survey let them provide their knowledge of AI or their perceptions of the difficulties and opportunities of these technologies in HEIs. Our study discovered how difficulties and opportunities associated with AI impact HEIs. This study aims to see how AI might assist higher education in Romania and Serbia. We also considered how they might be integrated with the educational system, and if instructors would utilise them. Developing creative and transversal skills is required to anticipate future breakthroughs and technological possibilitiesThe new methods of education focuses on ethics, values, problem-solving, and daily activities. Students’ learning material, how they might achieve critical abilities, and their educational changes must be addressed in the future. In this environment, colleges must create new digital skills in IA, machine learning, IoT, 5G, the cloud, big data, blockchain, data analysis, using MS Office and other applications, MOOCs, simulation applications, VR/AR, and gamification. They must also develop cross-disciplinary skills and a long-term mindset. © 2022 by the authors.

In 2011, when Germany first used the term Industry 4.0 to refer to the fourth industrial revolution, many changes in the way things are done have been discussed and applied. Industry 4.0 involves new technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT). However, the LM originally does not consider the possibilities of these new information technologies and current research highlights the need for studies on the applications of industry 4.0 technologies in LM environments. Thus, this research aims to identify, select, evaluate, and synthesize the relevant evidence available on the literature around the integration of Industry 4.0 technologies and LM. Design/methodology/approach - The research applied the method of systematic literature review on 107 articles, which were refined by this method. Findings - The creation of value and increase in the company's profit occurs through I4.0 technologies, such as the Internet of Things, Cyber Physical System, use of the Cloud, quality (big) data, Robotics, among others, which provide real-time capability, decentralization, modularity, interoperability, service orientation, and virtualization. Visualizing thus, a support of the industry 4.0 concept to LM and vice versa, where the technologies related to this concept allow improving the flow of information exchanged, guaranteeing the interconnection of machines, things and people. Research limitations/implication - Some important research may not have appeared in the search due to limitations of the systematic literature review method. Practical implications - The findings point insights directions for future research and provide practitioners with insights into the integration of Industry 4.0 technologies and with LM. Originality/value - The literature lacks articles that discuss the relationship of Industry 4.0 technologies with Lean Manufacturing. © 2022 Universidade do Minho.

Trust management (TM) has always been a challenging issue in a vehicular network. One such developing network is the Internet of vehicles (IoV), which is expected to be an essential part of smart cities. IoV originated from the merger of Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANET) and the Internet of things (IoT). Security is one of the main barriers in the on-road IoV implementation. Existing security standards are insufficient to meet the extremely dynamic and rapidly changing IoV requirements. Trust plays a vital role in ensuring security, especially during vehicle to vehicle communication. Vehicular networks, having a unique nature among other wireless ad hoc networks, require dedicated efforts to develop trust protocols. Current TM schemes are inflexible and static. Predefined scenarios and limited parameters are the basis for existing TMmodels that are not suitable for vehicle networks. The vehicular network requires agile and adaptive solutions to ensure security, especially when it comes to critical messages. The vehicle network's wireless nature increases its attack surface and exposes the network to numerous security threats. Moreover, internet involvement makes it more vulnerable to cyberattacks. The proposedTMframework is based on context-based cognition and machine learning to be best suited to IoV dynamics. Machine learning is the best solution to utilize the big data produced by vehicle sensors. To handle the uncertainty Bayesian machine learning statistical model is used. The proposed framework can adapt scenarios dynamically and infer using the maximum possible parameter available. The results indicated better performance than existing TM methods. Furthermore, for future work, a high-level machine learning model is proposed. © 2021 Tech Science Press.

This limited outbreak in a small province of China has rapidly evolved into a global pandemic that has led to a health and economic crisis. As millions of individuals have lost their lives, others have lost their jobs due to the recession of 2020. While the skills and educational mismatch have been a prevalent problem in the UAE labor market, it is logical to assume that the global pandemic has likely increased this problem’s extent. Therefore, there is an urgent need to adopt an agile, innovative solution to address the upcoming challenges in the labor markets due to the lack of skilled resources and the fear of future work amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Since industry and academia have identified skills and educational mismatch as a complex and multivariate problem, the paper builds a conceptual case from a system engineering perspective to solve this problem efficiently. Based on the literature reviewed related to disruptive technologies and labor market management systems, the paper proposes a new implementation approach for an integrated labor market information system enabled by the most widely used disruptive technologies components in the UAE (Machine Learning, AI, Blockchain, Internet of Things, Big Data Analytics, and Cloud Computing). The proposed approach is considered one of the immediate course of actions required to minimize the UAE economy’s negative impact due to the presence of the skills and educational mismatch phenomena. © 2021.

The implementation of these technologies in the Shipbuilding and Ship Repair Industry is currently in a nascent stage. Considering this, there is huge potential to produce cost savings, decrease production timelines, and drive down inefficiencies in the lifecycle management of ships. However, the implementation of these Industry 4.0 technologies is hindered by a noticeable gap in workforce capability and capacity. The shipbuilding and ship repair industry is projected to lose approximately 33% of its skilled workforce and 48% of management by 2028 [9]. With an aging workforce and an incoming digital generation that excels in tech savviness, flexibility, global thinking, and multi-tasking, it is crucial to be innovative in workforce development. The Virginia Digital Shipbuilding Program (VDSP) responds to this need by providing a process and platform to address education, training, and adoption of innovative new technology as well as the ability to provide real-time solutions to current and future industry problems. This paper will focus on the three pillars of Digital Shipbuilding - Career Pathway Mapping and Curriculum Development, Outreach and Workforce Development, and Research and Development.

With the advancement of manufacturing technology and the improvement of the level of intelligence, the physical failure of the conventional equipment in the daily operation of the system is rare, but the quality of the work-in-progress (WIP) is unqualified frequently. Especially the hidden functional failures such as reliability degradation of the final product have become increasingly prominent. How to model and characterize the functional failure of manufacturing systems has become a bottleneck restricting the application and development of holistic PHM (Prognostic and Health Management) technology of manufacturing systems. Therefore, a novel functional failure modeling and diagnostic strategy for intelligent manufacturing systems based on RQR chain is proposed in this paper, which includes the manufacturing system reliability (R) data, manufacturing process quality (Q) data and the produced product reliability (R) data. Firstly, the definition of the functional degradation process and principle of manufacturing systems is clarified from the perspective of RQR chain. Secondly, based on the established RQR chain, the functional fault connotation of manufacturing systems is defined, and the KPCs (key product characteristics) in the Bayesian network of integrated manufacturing systems are utilized. Big data are analyzed to model and predict the functional fault state of the running manufacturing systems. Thirdly, based on the relationship of RQR chain from right to left, the holistic functional fault diagnosis strategy is given.

Prefetching page table entries (PTEs) ahead of demand TLB accesses can mitigate the address translation performance bottleneck, but each prefetch requires traversing the page table, triggering additional accesses to the memory hierarchy. Therefore, TLB prefetching is a costly technique that may undermine performance when the prefetches are not accurate.In this paper we exploit the locality in the last level of the page table to reduce the cost and enhance the effectiveness of TLB prefetching by fetching cache-line adjacent PTEs ""for free"". We propose Sampling-Based Free TLB Prefetching (SBFP), a dynamic scheme that predicts the usefulness of these ""free""PTEs and prefetches only the ones most likely to prevent TLB misses. We demonstrate that combining SBFP with novel and state-of-the-art TLB prefetchers significantly improves miss coverage and reduces most memory accesses due to page walks.Moreover, we propose Agile TLB Prefetcher (ATP), a novel composite TLB prefetcher particularly designed to maximize the benefits of SBFP. ATP efficiently combines three low-cost TLB prefetchers and disables TLB prefetching for those execution phases that do not benefit from it. Unlike state-of-the-art TLB prefetchers that correlate patterns with only one feature (e.g., strides, PC, distances), ATP correlates patterns with multiple features and dynamically enables the most appropriate TLB prefetcher per TLB miss.To alleviate the address translation performance bottleneck, we propose a unified solution that combines ATP and SBFP. Across an extensive set of industrial workloads provided by Qualcomm, ATP coupled with SBFP improves geometric speedup by 16.2%, and eliminates on average 37% of the memory references due to page walks. Considering the SPEC CPU 2006 and SPEC CPU 2017 benchmark suites, ATP with SBFP increases geometric speedup by 11.1%, and eliminates page walk memory references by 26%. Applied to big data workloads (GAP suite, XSBench), ATP with SBFP yields a geometric speedup of 11.8% while reducing page walk memory references by 5%. Over the best state-of-the-art TLB prefetcher for each benchmark suite, ATP with SBFP achieves speedups of 8.7%, 3.4%, and 4.2% for the Qualcomm, SPEC, and GAP+XSBench workloads, respectively. © 2021 IEEE.","Address translation; Page table locality; Prefetching; Translation lookaside buffer; Virtual memory","Cache memory; Geometry; Address translation; Benchmark suites; Memory hierarchy; Memory references; Multiple features; Performance bottlenecks; Translation lookaside buffer; Unified solutions; Memory architecture",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",10636897,9781665433334,,,"English","Proc.

Big data that is associated with IoT could control systems, affect automation and the process industries require RD support to shape the concept into a functional asset that resolves the problems of users. Hence, investment in research and development (RD) as an integral part of any IoT project could be the first step towards project success. The objective of this study is to examine the effects of an investment in RD and size expansion on the firm value of the top Internet of Things companies. This study examines the top 20 Internet of Things companies in the world spanning the period from 2012 to 2019. By using the panel regression random effect model, this study yields two main conclusions. First, the expansion of size by the companies has a significant impact on promoting the firm value. Second, investment in RD is negatively associated with the firm value of the IoT companies at the initial stage but the lag effect of investment in RD is associated positively with the firm value. The significant size expansion impact on the firm value in the IoT firms suggests that the agile size could lead to more efficient use of resources and easy identification of growth opportunities. The second conclusion demonstrates the need for a budget allocation for the investment in RD for the technological progression and scientific advancement in the IoT companies. Although it takes a few years to observe the significant impacts of investment in RD on IoT firms, in the long term, it could improve the performance of IoT companies in driving the proliferation of connected devices to enhance human productivity and efficiency. © 2020 IEEE.","internet of things; Research and development; return on invested capital; size expansion","Budget control; Expansion; Investments; Man machine systems; Process control; Random processes; Budget allocation; Growth opportunities; Human productivity; Internet of thing (IOT); Process industries; Random-effect models; Research and development; Research development; Internet of things",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781728188614,,,"English","Proceeding - IEEE Conf.

Web application interface (API) as an emerging technique attracts more and more enterprises and organizations to publish their deep computing functionalities and big data on the Internet, Web API has become the backbone to promote the development of SOC, thus forming the prosperousWeb API economy. However, the number of available Web APIs on the Internet is massive and growing constantly, which causes the Web API overload problem. Quality of service (QoS) as an indicator is able to well differentiate the quality of Web APIs and has been widely applied for high quality Web API selection. Since testing QoS for massive Web APIs is resource-consuming, and the QoS performance depends on contextual information such as network and location, hence accurate QoS prediction has become very crucial for personalizedWeb API recommendation and high quality Web application construction. To address the above issue, this paper presents a context aware deep factorization machine model (CADFM for short) for accurate Web API QoS prediction. Specifically, we first carry out detailed data analysis using real-world QoS dataset and discover a positive relationship between QoS and contextual information, which motivates us to incorporate beneficial contexts for enhancing QoS prediction accuracy. Then, we treat QoS prediction as a regression problem and propose a context aware CADFM framework that integrates the contextual information via embedding technique. Particularly, we adopt MF and MLP for high-order and nonlinear interaction modeling, so as to learn the complex interaction between users andWeb APIs accurately. Finally, the experimental results on real-world QoS dataset demonstrate that CADFM outperforms the classic and the state-of-the-art baselines, thereby generating the most accurate QoS predictions and increasing the revenue of Web APIs recommendation. © 2020 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

Coupling this framework with the principle of security as a shared responsibility further enhances the efficacy of an integrated Development, Security, and Operations (DevSecOps) Team within organizations to deliver secured digital solutions. Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSPs) around the world are currently exploring and embracing the digital evolution shifting from monolithic, legacy automation platforms to an application framework of microservices to allow for flexible operations as capabilities and airspace operations evolve. Specific to the US, the ATM automation system of today is comprised of both safety and non-safety critical systems, with mission-essential, efficiency-critical, and mission-support services that are predominately maintained and evolved through multi-year, one contractor-led programs. Although the system has proven resilient, it has not proven to be agile and flexible to allow for advances in capabilities on-board aircraft or in the data integration and sharing with other NAS automation systems. This creates significant overhead in development, sustainability, and operations of the current automation system, and leaves modernization efforts - in terms of new capabilities - in constant investment decision planning cycles, costing agencies not just money, but more time to innovate. To advance aviation into a new generation of interoperability leveraging collaborative frameworks and application specific capabilities, ANSPs must adapt to innovative methods to collect, process, and deliver critical and essential aeronautical, weather, and flight information to air traffic control operators and ultimately to airspace users. Doing so can not only lead to sustaining NAS automation systems while reducing the costs to develop and operate these systems, but it also provides an opportunity to present strategies on how to dramatically reduce the time and integration efforts needed to deploy new capabilities. Leveraging cloud-native technologies and services is a way to realize this automation evolution vision for ANSPs.This paper examines the migration from today's systems to secure, cloud-native platforms to prove that Mission Services and Mission Applications can be rapidly available / deployable to operators who provide separation and flow management services, using a cyber-secured cloud-native environment. Aeronautical data typically used for tactical decision making is now seen as crucial to the decision-making process in Air Traffic Management (ATM). Integrating global and localized datasets into a digital aviation data platform enhances the capabilities of the solutions and opens the possibilities of leveraging big data analytics and microservices to compute trajectory predictions (TP), demand capacity balancing (DCB), arrival and departure sequencing, airspace delay, among others, in real-time to achieve operator-driven mission objectives. Technology has reached a state of maturity, especially in cloud and hybrid cloud solutions, to support safety of life operations, like ATM. This paper identifies approaches that are being considered for that migration to support the integration of new airspace entrants, the use of application services to provide a dynamic, evolutionary ATM platform, and addresses some of the safety and security strategies that must be considered for this evolution. © 2021 IEEE.","ATM; Automation; Cloud-native; Microservices","Air navigation; Air traffic control; Artificial intelligence; Automation; Complex networks; Cost reduction; Data integration; Integration; Integration testing; Interoperability; Safety engineering; Sustainable development; Agile Methodologies; Air navigation service providers; Air Traffic Management; Airspace management; Automation solutions; Automation systems; Cloud-native; Machine-learning; Microservice; Rapid application development; Application programs",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",21557195,9781665434201,ADACF,,"English","AIAA IEEE Dig Avionics Syst Conf Proc",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85122816710

The global business ecosystem is changing and there is growing demand for multi-modal digital technologies, big data consolidation and data analytics to harness a cost-competitive agile system. Technological convergence and integration of digital systems is one of the preferred methodologies that facilitates new and effective workflows and revives business processes. The progressive interlinking of digital technologies with business operations leads to the convergence and blending of management disciplines, devices and applications. The growing inconsistencies in managerial understanding regarding the benefits of convergence prompts a comprehensive examination of digital convergence pathways, identifying the impacts on converging entities and business objectives. The State bank of India (SBI) mega-merger case study was selected to investigate the pragmatic framework of digital convergence and to understand the impacts on interlinked entities such as: business operations, strategic management, project team that support value creation and competitive differentiation. The purpose of this paper is to focus on the phenomena of techno-fusion of emerging technologies creating new opportunities, business models and unique strategies for global banking and financial service organizations. Design/methodology/approach: This study applies the qualitative, inductive research method using critical reflection of before and after the implementation of convergence and digital integration strategies. The SBI case study employs this research strategy based on the premise that banks must stay agile and highly responsive to the changing environment to enhance its value proposition and competitive differentiation objectives. The study methodology incorporates cooperative inquiry and multiple levels of analysis using data collection techniques of exhaustive review of archives, informal interviews, questionnaires and observations to identify the synergistic process improvement pathway. The study is grounded on the concept that the convergence of diverse business pathways involves innovative and interlinked project, strategic and information technology (IT) workflows that results in open innovative systems. Findings: The studies identify that organizational innovation and creative solutions are a result of ecosystem turbulence, environmental force diversity, competitive pressure and the need for differentiation. Organizations that harness the power of digital fusion and convergence of management, systems and data generate a competitive advantage. The technological convergence strategy pulls multiple business and technology processes (project, strategic, IT, Cloud, AI and business process management) at the organizational, divisional or functional level generating new opportunities and threats, new business models and unique growth strategies for global banking and financial services organizations. Organizations that fully integrate techno-fusion of business and digital strategies produce synergistic effects and enhance adaptability, innovation and resiliency in the face of competitive challenges. Research limitations/implications: Additional areas that can be explored further as an extension of this study are listed below: identifying factors to improve the speed of convergence; the current results are limited to large size organizations where formal management and technology functions are distinctive. Similar studies on smaller organizations are warranted. Originality/value: This study focuses on the evolving field of technology innovation, which is increasingly being intertwined with business operations. Innovative digital technology is enabling the convergence of the disciplines of management, digital devices and applications. This facilitates the creation of a pragmatic framework that supports convergence of business operations, strategic management and digital fusion which leads to value creation and competitive differentiation.

Concurrently, logistics operations are undergoing constant change as new technologies such as the internet of things (IoT), cloud computing, and big data are implemented. These Internet of Things devices enhance the functionality of the logistics function by enhancing real-time product tracking, improving data collection, and intelligently storing logistics data, among other things. Because of the centralised database structure of these logistics systems, certain of these new technologies open the door to the possibility of cyberattacks on these systems. The parties involved in the logistics operations must communicate with one another in order to share confidential information about customers and details about products. This is due to the fact that so many logistics stakeholders are being engaged in the process. It is vulnerable to unauthorised access, which may result in fraudulent activity or the production of counterfeit goods by a malicious actor operating within the system. All of these challenges are significant because maintaining the integrity of the logistics data is essential to providing good service to customers. The application of Blockchain's special features, such as immutability, efficient cryptography, and a distributed decentralised storage system, will be used to address these challenges once it is deployed as an innovation. In conclusion, Blockchain has the potential to improve operational efficiency while also ensuring the safety of the data involved in the logistics process. According to the findings of the study, the technologies underlying Industry 4.0 have the potential to make supply chains more agile, transparent, and resilient. In addition, the study demonstrates that despite the fact that the advantages of integrating technologies related to Industry 4.0 into supply chains are widely acknowledged, there is still a dearth of applications, related research, and actual-world use cases. Nevertheless, it is abundantly clear that companies that do not adopt the technologies will eventually go out of business. In the event that the pandemic has revealed bottlenecks in the practises we use for our supply chain, the solution is to integrate advanced technologies from Industry 4.0. © 2023, Ismail Saritas.

Design/methodology/approach: This paper is written as a critical essay reflecting the experience and reflections of the author with many ideas drawn from and extending selected items from project management, artificial intelligence (AI) and analytics literatures. Findings: Neither AI nor sophisticated analytics is likely to elicit hands on attention from project managers, other than those producing AI or analytics-based artifacts or using these tools to create their products and services. However, through the conduit of packaged software support for project management, new tools and approaches can be expected to more effectively support current activities, to streamline or eliminate activities that can be automated, to extend current capabilities with the availability of increased data, computing capacity and mathematically based algorithms and to suggest ways to reconceive how projects are done and whether they are needed.

The intelligent analysis, modeling, and management of agricultural and forest ecosystems, and of the use and protection of soils, already play important roles in securing our planet for future generations and will become irreplaceable in the future. Technical solutions must encompass the entire agricultural and forestry value chain. The process of digital transformation is supported by cyber-physical systems enabled by advances in ML, the availability of big data and increasing computing power. For certain tasks, algorithms today achieve performances that exceed human levels. The challenge is to use multimodal information fusion, i.e., to integrate data from different sources (sensor data, images, *omics), and explain to an expert why a certain result was achieved. However, ML models often react to even small changes, and disturbances can have dramatic effects on their results. Therefore, the use of AI in areas that matter to human life (agriculture, forestry, climate, health, etc.) has led to an increased need for trustworthy AI with two main components: explainability and robustness. One step toward making AI more robust is to leverage expert knowledge. For example, a farmer/forester in the loop can often bring in experience and conceptual understanding to the AI pipeline—no AI can do this. Consequently, human-centered AI (HCAI) is a combination of “artificial intelligence” and “natural intelligence” to empower, amplify, and augment human performance, rather than replace people. To achieve practical success of HCAI in agriculture and forestry, this article identifies three important frontier research areas: (1) intelligent information fusion; (2) robotics and embodied intelligence; and (3) augmentation, explanation, and verification for trusted decision support. This goal will also require an agile, human-centered design approach for three generations (G). G1: Enabling easily realizable applications through immediate deployment of existing technology.

During drilling operations, the real-time drilling data are streamed to a real-time centre where it is constantly monitored by a dedicated team of monitoring specialists. If any potential issues or possible opportunities arise, the team will communicate with the operation team on rig for an intervention. This workflow is further enhanced by digital initiatives via big data analytics implementation in PETRONAS. The Digital Standing Instruction to Driller (Digital SID) is a drilling operational procedures documentation tool meant to improve the current process by digitalizing information exchange between office and rig site. Boasting multi-operation usage, it is made fit to context and despite its automated generation, this tool allows flexibility for the operation team to customize the content and more importantly, monitor the execution in real-time. Another tool used in the real-time monitoring platform is the dynamic monitoring drilling system where it allows real-time drilling data to be more intuitive and gives the benefit of foresight. The dynamic nature of the system means that it will update existing roadmaps with extensive real-time data as they come in, hence improving its accuracy as we drill further. Furthermore, an automated drilling key performance indicator (KPI) and performance benchmarking system measures drilling performance to uncover areas of improvement. This will serve as the benchmark for further optimization. On top of that, an artificial intelligence (AI) driven Wells Augmented Stuck Pipe Indicator (WASP) is deployed in the real-time monitoring platform to improve the capability of monitoring specialists to identify stuck pipe symptoms way earlier before the occurrence of the incident. This proactive approach is an improvement to the current process workflow which is less timely and possibly missing the intervention opportunity. These four tools are integrated seamlessly with the real-time monitoring platform hence improving the project management efficiency during the execution phase. The tools are envisioned to offer an agile and efficient process workflow by integrating and tapering down multiple applications in different environments into a single web-based platform which enables better collaboration and faster decision making.

Rapid technological advances open up opportunities to develop Geographical Information System (GIS) based mobile applications using embedded features inherent in mobile devices as well as application framework components and APIs. The evolution in Global Positioning System (GPS) technology has improved the accessibility and navigation accuracy in mobile applications. Islam has set some specific rukhsah (concession) concepts that can be applied by musafir (muslim travellers) including prayers of jama' and qasar (combine and shorten) if the journey exceeds two (2) marhalah which has been decided as 81km by Malaysian Islamic Authority. Currently there aren't any well-defined application available to assist them in fulfilling their obligation in Malaysia. myMarhalah is a mobile GIS application developed to facilitate musafir with their journey by displaying navigation routes, calculating travelled distances, identifying permissible leniency for prayers, locating nearby mosques, showing prayer times and listing the answers for frequently asked questions on related issues. The application uses open source native cross platform development that supports agile software development life cycle (SDLC) and allows DevOps to develop full native application for iOS and android simultaneously. This saves a lot of time in maintenance and upgrades. Equipped with artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies, myMarhalah provides multiple route options to users and dynamically changes active navigation based on user's decision. Integration with mosque location allows users to navigate to the mosque of their choice in the middle of the journey to perform prayer and navigate back to the final destination seamlessly. The application also adopted big data technology in its search and query functions for better user experience (UX). With the absence of distinct application for musafir in Malaysia, myMarhalah is the first one-stop mobile GIS application that provides convenient solution for them to implement the concession concept in their journey. It is also in line with the Malaysian Government's Digitalisation Strategy to improve public service delivery using emerging technologies. © ACRS 2021.All right reserved.","Artificial Intelligence; Geographical Information System (GIS); Machine Learning Technique; Mobile Application","Application programming interfaces (API); Application programs; Global positioning system; Information systems; Information use; Life cycle; Machine learning; Mobile computing; Navigation; Open source software; Open systems; Remote sensing; Software design; Space applications; Application frameworks; Geographical information system; Global positioning system technology; Information systems application; Machine learning techniques; Malaysia; Mobile applications; Navigation accuracy; Smart phones; Technological advances; Geographic information systems",,,"Asian Association on Remote Sensing",,9781713843818,,,"English","Asian Conf.

The advancement of the 4IR technologies introduced the era of digital technology, whereby all sectors, government institutions, small and medium enterprises are seeking these technologies such as the internet of things (IoT), artificial intelligence, and machine learning to name but few. Yet, there is a perception that the South African manufacturing sector is lagging behind with the adoption of these advanced technologies. Moreover, some of these manufacturers are still depending on their traditional methods and conventional machine tools. Meanwhile, the era of digital technology has presented these tools with sectors that had successfully achieved a competitive advantage within the marketplace. As a result, this paper analyses the factors contributing to economic growth and sustainability in relation to the adoption and usage of new technologies. The paper provides some insights into the readiness and adaption of the South African manufacturing sector of the new technologies as well as the global conformity with 4IR. Sectors are being forced to rethink their business processes and the way they conduct business. In response to the challenges deriving from globalization, manufacturing companies today face the need for more flexible and agile manufacturing equipment. Also, the pressure has been posed by their competitors that have taken advantage of these technologies and noted significant improvement in cost reduction, cycle time, productivity, and safety issues. Clearly, the usage of the industry 4.0 tools such as automation, robotics, smart production, artificial intelligence, and big data presents opportunities. From the South African manufacturing perspective, 4IR is challenging a sector that has been in decline for the past decade due to a lack of adopting advanced manufacturing technologies. Whereas this sector is one of the sectors that is expected to strengthen economic growth and job creation. Findings suggest that there is a need to rethink the current production systems in order to develop a manufacturing digital transformation model that enables the conversion to smart factories, automation processes, real-time data of production process, and marketplace. The findings also revealed that there are few component elements that need serious attention, namely, ICT infrastructure, high tech skilled retention, development of the high-tech skilled workforce, particularly digitally skilled workers-which is the main problem in both developed and developing countries. © IEOM Society International.","Digital technology; Economic growth; Industry 4.0; Manufacturing; Sustainability",,,,"IEOM Society",21698767,9781792361234,,,"English","Proc.

At the same time products and services are evolving permanently. In order to cope with those circumstances, manufacturers should apply the principles of smart manufacturing together with continuous processes improvement. Smart manufacturing is a concept where production is no longer highly labor-intensive and based only on flexible manufacturing systems, but production as a whole process should be monitored and controlled with sophisticated information technology, integrated on all stages of the product life cycle. Process improvements in Smart Manufacturing are heavily reliance on decisions, which can be achieved by using modeling and simulation of systems with different analyzing tools based on Big Data processing and Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies. This study was performed to automate an estimation process and improve the accuracy for production celĺs performance evaluation. Although there have been researches performed in the same field, the substantial estimation process outcome and accuracy still need to be elaborated further. In this article a robot integrated production cell simulation framework is developed. A developed system is used to simulate production cell parametric models in the real-life situations. A set of rules and constraints are created and inserted into the simulation model. Data for the constraints were acquired by investigating industries' best production cells performance parameters. Information was gathered in four main fields: company profile and strategy, cell layout and equipment, manufactured products process data and shortcomings of goal achievements or improvement necessary to perform. From those parametric case model, a 3D virtual manufacturing simulation model is built and simulated for achieving accurate results. The integration of manufacturing data into decision making process through advanced prescriptive analytics models is a one of the future tasks of this study. The integration makes it possible to use ""best practice""data and obtained Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) results to find the optimal solutions in real manufacturing conditions. The objective is to find the best solution of robot integrated cell for a certain industry using AI enabled simulation model. It also helps to improve situation assessment and deliberated decision-making mechanism..

Gemelli IRCCS, Rome, Italy","Background: Heart failure (HF) is a multifaceted clinical syndrome characterized by different etiologies, risk factors, comorbidities, and a heterogeneous clinical course. The current model, based on data from clinical trials, is limited by the biases related to a highly-selected sample in a protected environment, constraining the applicability of evidence in the real-world scenario. If properly leveraged, the enormous amount of data from real-world may have a groundbreaking impact on clinical care pathways. We present, here, the development of an HF DataMart framework for the management of clinical and research processes. Methods: Within our institution, Fondazione Policlinico Universitario A. Gemelli in Rome (Italy), a digital platform dedicated to HF patients has been envisioned (GENERATOR HF DataMart), based on two building blocks: 1. All retrospective information has been integrated into a multimodal, longitudinal data repository, providing in one single place the description of individual patients with drill-down functionalities in multiple dimensions. This functionality might allow investigators to dynamically filter subsets of patient populations characterized by demographic characteristics, biomarkers, comorbidities, and clinical events (e.g., re-hospitalization), enabling agile analyses of the outcomes by subsets of patients. 2. With respect to expected long-term health status and response to treatments, the use of the disease trajectory toolset and predictive models for the evolution of HF has been implemented. The methodological scaffolding has been constructed in respect of a set of the preferred standards recommended by the CODE-EHR framework. Results: Several examples of GENERATOR HF DataMart utilization are presented as follows: to select a specific retrospective cohort of HF patients within a particular period, along with their clinical and laboratory data, to explore multiple associations between clinical and laboratory data, as well as to identify a potential cohort for enrollment in future studies; to create a multi-parametric predictive models of early re-hospitalization after discharge; to cluster patients according to their ejection fraction (EF) variation, investigating its potential impact on hospital admissions. Conclusion: The GENERATOR HF DataMart has been developed to exploit a large amount of data from patients with HF from our institution and generate evidence from real-world data. The two components of the HF platform might provide the infrastructural basis for a combined patient support program dedicated to continuous monitoring and remote care, assisting patients, caregivers, and healthcare professionals. 2023 D'Amario, Laborante, Delvinoti, Lenkowicz, Iacomini, Masciocchi, Luraschi, Damiani, Rodolico, Restivo, Ciliberti, Paglianiti, Canonico, Paternello, Cesario, Valentini, Scambia and Crea.","artificial intelligence; big data; datamart; heart failure; machine learning","beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; hemoglobin; mineralocorticoid antagonist; aged; algorithm; Article; artificial intelligence; big data; clinical practice; cohort analysis; data warehouse; echocardiography; female; generator heart failure datamart; glomerulus filtration rate; health status; heart failure; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; hospital admission; hospital readmission; hospitalization; human; length of stay; machine learning; major clinical study; male; outcome assessment; retrospective study; risk factor; support vector machine; treatment response","D’Amario, D.; Department of Cardiovascular and Pulmonary Sciences, Italy; email: domenico.damario@gmail.com",,"Frontiers Media S.A.",2297055X,,,,"English","Front.
