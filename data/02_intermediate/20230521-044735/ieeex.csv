,ieeex,Achieving Agile Big Data Science: The Evolution of a Team’s Agile Process Methodology,"While there has been a rapid increase in the use of data science and the related field of big data, there has been minimal discussion on how teams using these techniques should best plan, coordinate and communicate their activities. To help address this gap, this paper reports on a mixed method qualitative study exploring how a big data science team within a Fortune 500 organization used two different agile process methodologies. The study helps clarify the concept of agility within a big data science project, as well as the key process challenges teams encounter when executing a big data science project. Specifically, three key issues were identified: (a) the challenge in task duration estimation, (b) how to account for team members that might be pulled onto other tasks for short bursts and (c) coordination challenges across the different groups within the big data science team. Our findings help explain how different process methodologies might mitigate or exacerbate these challenges and supports previous research showing that big data science teams would benefit from an increased focus on their process methodology and that adopting an Agile Kanban methodology, which focuses on minimizing work-in-progress, could prove beneficial for many big data science teams.",Big Data Science;Agile;Process Methodology,J.

,ieeex,SKI: An Agile Framework for Data Science,"This paper explores data science project management by first noting the need for a new process management framework and then defines a process framework that effectively supports the needs of a data science team. The paper also reports on a pilot study of teams using the framework. The framework adheres to the lean Kanban philosophy but augments Kanban by providing a structured iteration process for teams to incrementally explore and learn via lean hypothesis testing. Specifically, the Structured Kanban Iteration (SKI) framework focuses on having teams define capability-based iterations (as opposed to Kanban-like no iterations or Scrumlike time-based sprints). Furthermore, unlike Kanban, the framework leverages Scrum best practices to define roles, meetings and artifacts. Thus, SKI implements the Kanban process, but with a more repeatable and structured approach.",Data Science;Big Data;Agile;Process Methodology,J. Saltz; A.

,ieeex,On the Application of SCRUM in Data Science Projects,"The emerging discipline of Data Science poses several challenges for teams conducting projects in the field as notably, the majority of Data Science teams fail to deliver the expected outcomes. To improve the results, researchers tried to adapt agile project methodologies like Scrum for Data Science projects. Scrum in particular is often implemented due its success in software engineering. However, the basic Scrum framework has proven itself to be too strict for Data Science, due to frequent unpredictabilities of Data Science tasks. Consequently, adaptions were made to traditional Scrum to make it more suitable for the new challenges. This article discusses further adaptations and suggests that Scrum in itself is usable in Data Science, however, additional adaptations of the core concepts need to be envisioned.",SCRUM;data science;project management,N.

,ieeex,The Waterfall Model with Agile Scrum as the Hybrid Agile Model for the Software Engineering Team,"Hybrid agile is a software development model that combines the agile approach with a non-agile development strategy. A software engineering team chooses the hybrid agile to best fit the development process based on project needs; some projects require a plan-driven approach, and at the same time, agility is a must. However, among many agile methodologies and plan-driven development models, which methodologies or models adopted by a software engineering team lead to hybrid agile. This research aims to identify the software engineering team's approach and model that resulted in the emergence of a hybrid agile model. Data for this research were acquired through a qualitative study using interviews as the data collection instrument and thematic analysis is used to analyze the data and identify the theme. In the context of this paper, we focus on only one (1) theme, which is “models used in a software project”. According to the research findings, the agile Scrum and Waterfall models are the models that have been practised in software projects that have resulted in the hybrid agile model. In the near future, further research will be conducted to determine which process model is employed in certain software process phases of a software project.",Hybrid agile;Scrum;Waterfall model;Software engineering team,N.

The study consisted of a survey of 109 industry professionals, as well as an evaluation of relevant framework terms searched at Google. Overall, CRISP-DM was the most commonly used framework, with Scrum and Kanban being the second and third most frequently used. We note that CRISP-DM is a life cycle framework, whereas Scrum and Kanban are team coordination frameworks.

Big data projects are different from software engineering projects in all three aspects - people, processes and technologies. Recent research has shown that agile approaches are suitable and beneficial when applied in big data projects. The aim of the current study is to investigate which of the agile software development methodologies are currently applied in big data projects and what are the key considerations for their application. As a first step towards achieving this aim, the paper presents a systematic literature review of research articles reporting real-world experience of adopting agile methodologies in different big data science contexts.

,ieeex,Applying Scrum in Data Science Projects,"The rise of big data has led to an increase in data science projects conducted by organizations. Such projects aim to create valuable insights by improving decision making or enhancing an organization's service offering through data-driven services. However, the majority of data science projects still fail to deliver the expected value. To increase the success rate of projects, the use of process models or methodologies is recommended in the literature. Nevertheless, organizations are hardly using them because they are considered too rigid and they do not support the typical iterative and open nature of data science projects. To overcome this problem, this research suggests applying Agile methodologies to data science projects. Agile methodologies were originally developed in the software engineering domain and are characterised by their iterative approach towards software development. In this study, we selected the Scrum approach and integrated it into the CRISP-DM methodology for data science projects using a Design Science Research approach. This new methodology was then evaluated in three different case organizations using expert interviews.

During this time, the practices of running such projects, together with the tools used to run them, have evolved considerably. Furthermore, there are various studies on data science workflows and data science project teams. However, studies looking into both workflows and teams are still scarce and comprehensive works to build a holistic view do not exist. This study bases on a prior case study on roles and processes in data science. The goal here is to create a deeper understanding of data science projects and development processes. We conducted a survey targeted at experts working in the field of data science (n=50) to understand data science projects’ team structure, roles in the teams, utilized project management practices and the challenges in data science work. Results show little difference between big data projects and other data science.

The problem of choosing Agile techniques is complicated by the fact that each of the known frameworks has its own advantages and disadvantages. Depending on the type of project, a particular tool can influence various criteria for the success of the project. In addition, research has shown that some enterprises use separate elements of a particular framework. Therefore, the scientific novelty of the article lies in the study of the influence of individual elements of Agile techniques on the success of the project and its course.

This approach emphasizes employing experienced and committed individuals. In this approach, team management is different from what the disciplined methods defined. In this condition, team organization, team members’ roles, and responsibilities, and project control methods need to be defined in a new form. Although some Agile methods define particular roles, it seems that team structure in Agile projects in real projects is different from what is expected. This paper aimed to propose a common team structure and setup for Agile teams in practice. Differences in the Agile and plan-driven approaches in software development lead to define new concepts such as team self-organization, on-site customer, leadership, and collaboration in Agile teams.

In brief, CRISP-DM, which is the most popular framework teams use to execute data science projects, provides an easy to understand description of the data science project workflow (i.e., the data science life cycle). However, CRISP-DM’s project phases miss some key aspects of the data science project life cycle. In addition, CRISP-DM’s task-focused approach fails to address how a team should prioritize tasks, and in general, collaborate and communicate.

,ieeex,Using Big Data Analytics to Create a Predictive Model for Joint Strike Fighter,"The amount of information needed to acquire knowledge on today's acquisition systems is growing exponentially due to more complex, higher resolution, software-intensive acquisition systems that need to operate in System-of-Systems (SoS), Family-of-Systems (FoS), Joint, and Coalition environments. Unfortunately, the tools and methods necessary to rapidly collect, aggregate, and analyze this information have not evolved as a whole in conjunction with this increased system complexity and, therefore, has made analysis and evaluation increasingly deficient and ineffective. The Test Resource Management Center's (TRMC's) vision is to build a DoD test and evaluation (T&E) knowledge management (KM) and analysis capability that leverages commercial big data analysis and cloud computing technologies to improve evaluation quality and reduce decision-making time. An evaluation revolution, starting with the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) program, is underway to ensure the T&E community can support the demands of next-generation weapon systems.The true product of T&E is knowledge ascertained through the collection of information about a system or item under test. However, the T&E community's ability to provide this knowledge is hampered by more complex systems, more complex environments, and the need to be more agile in support of strategic initiatives, such as agile acquisition and the 3rd Offset Strategy. This increased complexity and need for speed cause delayed analysis and problems that go undetected during T&E. The primary reason for these shortfalls is antiquated tools and processes that make data hard to locate, aggregate, and convert into knowledge. In short, DoD has not evolved its evaluation infrastructure as its weapon systems have evolved.Conversely, commercial entities, such as medical observation and diagnosis, electric power distribution, retail, and industrial manufacturing, have embraced agility in their methodologies while modernizing analytics capabilities to keep up with the massive influx of data. Raw physical sensors could provide data, higher-quality image or video cameras, radio frequency identification (RFID) devices, faster data collectors, more detailed point-of-sale information or digitized records, and ultimately is providing more data to analysts in size and complexity than ever before. As more data has become available, an interrelated phenomenon is the desire of analysts to ask more detailed questions about their consumers and their business infrastructure. To drive the process of implementing big data analytics, businesses have begun establishing analytics centers which either take pre-defined business cases and apply methods to address them or implement existing knowledge within the data architecture to create a higher level of awareness to business groups or the company at-large. To meet these demands, data storage and computation architectures have become more sophisticated, dozens of technologies were developed for large-scale processing (such as Apache Hadoop or GreenPlum), and streaming architectures which allow data to be processed and actioned on in real-time as it is collected have become commonplace.

,ieeex,Automotive Big Data Pipeline: Disaggregated Hyper-Converged Infrastructure vs Hyper-Converged Infrastructure,"Big data disrupts everything it touches, but automotive is probably one of the top industries that enjoy and leverage the benefits. The Automotive Big Data Pipeline (ABDP) is a Big Data pipeline base on the automotive use case and is required to scale up agile and high performance in real-time or in batch. Nonetheless, there're many alternative infrastructure designs but lack of knowledge, which fits the best for the automotive domain. It leads this paper into a question: What kinds of infrastructure design could provide better performance for the ABDP?In this paper, we introduce two well-known infrastructure designs called Hyper-Converged infrastructure (HCI) and Disaggregated Hyper-Converged infrastructure (DHCI). HCI combines standard data center hardware using locally attached storage resources to create fast, common building blocks. However, does single standard hardware fit all the requirements? DHCI scale independently from compute and storage provides an option. It provides a more cost-efficient and flexible solution; however, there is no comparison from the performance point of view. Therefore, to address it, our objective is to conduct an empirical performance comparison to see which one performs better.The experiment result shows that DHCI performs almost the same as HCI on CPU utilization, memory, and network consumption. However, regarding storage and running time metrics, DHCI performs slightly higher storage throughput, IOPs, and less running time than HCI.",,C. J. Wang; B.

The literature has been showing that there is a significant gap between the problems defined by the research in data mining and the problems in real world projects. The gap is to the level of semantics between the data scientists and the business users. Trying to fill this gap, we have developed an improved Agile data mining framework to fulfill the government business objectives and needs. The previous works had been claiming that handling such project is not yet mature in the region. For this an Agile implementation framework is required. We are also proposing a systematic way for identifying business problems as part of the framework. The process is Agile, so it would start from investigating the data set dimensions to identify business problems. It also allows early Business people cooperation with data scientist. We've applied the proposed framework in one of the Middle East government organizations. The business team and the data scientists have been showing their satisfaction regarding the results of using the proposed framework. The proposed framework have helped both business and data scientist to implement their first initiative in data mining. The proposed framework also helped in efficiently mapping the project with the core business objectives and problems using real world dataset.","data mining, data science, agile framework, business problems, business objectives",W.

,ieeex,What is Good Feedback in Big Data Projects for Cyberinfrastructure Diffusion in e-Science?,"This paper investigates the role of feedback in big data projects for cyberinfrastructure (CI) diffusion in e-science. For many of these projects, large-scale and heterogeneous datasets, multidisciplinary and dispersed experts, and advanced technologies are brought together to harness analytic insights. However, without effective CI and computational tools, the accuracy and meaningfulness of analytics results are compromised. In fact, without CI tools, raw data remain raw with hidden insights, as data analytics cannot be executed at all. In order to improve such tools for meaningful results, we argue to conceptualize the communication mechanism of `feedback' in agile software development, with the goal of producing CI tools that are responsive to users. Based on a grounded analysis of interview data, we concluded that feedback helps developers in big data projects understand users' needs, makes tools user-friendly, prevents emergencies, and is better for developers than no feedback. Furthermore, good feedback is often structured, specific, actionable, timely, generalizable, and delivered in a tactful way. Despite the limitation of the findings being exploratory and yet to be evaluated experimentally, we argued that they still can motivate developers to be proactive seekers of feedback for their tools, productively guide developers' communication with users, and ultimately promote further adoption and diffusion of CI tools in e-science.",feedback;agile software development;e-science;cyberinfrastructure;technology adoption;diffusion of innovations,K.

Many studies highlight how to rapidly make or change the plans with detecting advance information. One of the widely used solutions is to evaluate the agile organization's decision-making capability based the time-domain metrics. However, the dynamic assignment capability always changed during task operating within time-domain. It caused that the planning used the wrong organization capability in the most time. In this paper, we develop an improved simulated annealing algorithm to address this problem. In order to discretize the time-domain, we propose a horizon partition that is based on the task dynamic state. Finally, the optimization model is tested in a toy example. Compared with the traditional models, the results show the proposed model has better outcomes for accurately estimating dynamic agile organization capability.",Operational System of Systems (SoS);Agile organization;Adaptive Optimization;Simulated Annealing;Decision Making,Y.

,ieeex,Towards Prediction of Security Attacks on Software Defined Networks: A Big Data Analytic Approach,"Cyber-physical systems (CPS) tightly integrate physical and computing processes by monitoring and control data interacting between them via underlying networks. Software Defined Network (SDN) Technology has increasingly become essential in many advanced computer networks, including those in modern CPS, to provide flexible and agile network development. Despite many benefits that SDN offers, malicious attacks that can eventually prevent network services are unavoidable. Among the most predominant attacks on SDN controller layer, Link Discovery Attack and ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) Spoofing Attack are fundamental in that they are the gateways of many other SDN threats and attacks. To defend these attacks, most existing techniques either rely on relatively complex data validation techniques or use thresholds that can be subjective and unable to detect more than one type of attacks at a time if one deciding factor is used. While Big data technology, particularly machine learning, has been widely used for intrusion/anomaly detection, little has been done in SDN. This paper explores how well this technology can be used to predict these SDN attacks. By employing typical machine learning algorithms on simulated data of routing in SDN when attacks occur, preliminary results, obtained from four machine learning models, show the average area under ROC curve of over 96% and 92% for sample size 50,970 (12 switches) and 60,000 (20 switches), respectively. Further experiments show near-linear scaling in training time for the best performing algorithm when sample size grows up to 100,000.",Software-Defined Networking;SDN-specific security;Link Discovery attack;ARP Spoofing attack;Machine Learning;Data Analytic Applications,E.

In this work, the competition between a frequency agile (FA) radar and a noise-modulated jammer is considered. As modern FA radar adopts coherent processing with several pulses, the competition is hence in a multiple-round way where each pulse can be modeled as one round interaction between the radar and jammer. To capture such multiple-round property as well as imperfect information inside the game, i.e., radar and jammer are unable to know the upcoming signal, we propose an extensive-form game formulation for such competition. Since the number of game information states grows exponentially with respect to number of pulses, finding Nash Equilibrium (NE) strategies may be a computationally intractable task. To effectively solve the game, a learning-based algorithm called deep Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) is utilized. Numerical simulations demonstrates the effectiveness of deep CFR algorithm for approximately finding NE and obtaining the best response strategy.",Frequency agile radar;anti-jamming problem;extensive form game,H.

Use of big data analytics (BDA) can be a differentiator for organizations seeking to improve agility to quickly sense and respond to novel and complex events. Usage of BDA comprises two types: the routine use and the ad hoc use. The latter is more associated with the unplanned analysis of big data to understand unexpected events, and its effects have not been studied in distinction to the former in the analytics literature. We draw on sensemaking, the organizational theory of the process of understanding novel and complex events, to investigate how the ad hoc use of BDA improves agility of organizations. Analysis of a survey of 107 business executives and senior managers demonstrated the positive effects of the ad hoc use of BDA on agility, through mediation by sensemaking.",big data;analytics;ad hoc use;sensemaking;agility,R.

The available datasets are mostly small and unbalanced, resulting in non-optimal classification when the algorithms are implemented. In this study, five novel machine learning experiments are conducted to address the challenges of small datasets by expanding these into big data and then utilising Random Forests. The experiments are based on personalised adaptable strategies for both balanced and unbalanced datasets. Multiple datasets from cryotherapy and immunotherapy are considered, however, hereby only immunotherapy is used. In the first experiment, artificially generated data is presented by increasing the observations of the dataset, each new data is four-time larger than the previous one, resulting in better classification. In the second experiment, the effect of volume on classification is considered based on the number of attributes. The attributes of each new dataset are built based on conditional probabilities. It did not make any difference, in obtained classification, when the number of attributes is increased to more than 879. In the third simulation experiment, classes of data are classified manually by dividing the data into a two-dimensional plane. This experiment is first performed on small data and then on expanded big data: by increasing observations, an accuracy of 73.68% is attained. In the fourth experiment, the visualisation of the enlarged data did not provide better insights. In the fifth experiment, the impact of correlations among datasets’ attributes on classification is observed, however, no improvements in performance are achieved.

,ieeex,An Agile Sample Maintenance Approach for Agile Analytics,"Agile analytics can help organizations to gain and sustain a competitive advantage by making timely decisions. Approximate query processing (AQP) is one of the useful approaches in agile analytics, which facilitates fast queries on big data by leveraging a pre-computed sample. One problem such a sample faces is that when new data is being imported, re-sampling is most likely needed to keep the sample fresh and AQP results accurate enough. Re-sampling from scratch for every batch of new data, called the full re-sampling method and adopted by many existing AQP works, is obviously a very costly process, and a much quicker incremental sampling process, such as reservoir sampling, may be used to cover the newly arrived data. However, incremental update methods suffer from the fact that the sample size cannot be increased, which is a problem when the underlying data distribution dramatically changes and the sample needs to be enlarged to maintain the AQP accuracy. This paper proposes an adaptive sample update (ASU) approach that avoids re-sampling from scratch as much as possible by monitoring the data distribution, and uses instead an incremental update method before a re-sampling becomes necessary. The paper also proposes an enhanced approach (T-ASU), which tries to enlarge the sample size without re-sampling from scratch when a bit of query inaccuracy is tolerable to further reduce the sample update cost. These two approaches are integrated into a state-of-the-art AQP engine for an extensive experimental study. Experimental results on both real-world and synthetic datasets show that the two approaches are faster than the full re-sampling method while achieving almost the same AQP accuracy when the underlying data distribution continuously changes.",,H.

,ieeex,Big Data Analytics APIs Architecture for Formative Assessors,"This Research to Practice Full Paper is driven by the question: Within limited time resources available to trainers in projects for Big Data Analytics (BDA) problems, how can they define project requirements for Formative Assessment (FA) actions? The paper suggests BDA APIs architecture as helping tool for formative assessors. It helps them effectively produce and adapt visual diagnostic reports for FA-actions in agile based requirements (i.e. features) definition. The paper presents two core architectures: Architecture for a parametrized feature-descriptor-system to define/refine a BDA API feature and its visual diagnostic reports, and an initial resources architecture for BDA API to initialize an analytics algorithm with its input big data sets. Clarifying visually the trainee's challenges (i.e. incremental features in a BDA API) is our main FA action. The FA action is designed based on Csikszentmihalyi's flow model to support a trainee in matching balance between his/her challenges and his/her skills. To test the architecture's functions, the paper has test setups for two formal projects (each has 1 to 6 trainees) and two informal projects (each has 1 to 3 trainees). The projects are to attack BDA problems in learning analytics and in image automatic classification. The test results show that the visual diagnostic reports produced by the trainers are very effective in clarifying visually incremental BDA API features not only for simple classifiers (i.e. classical data mining algorithms) but also for complex classifiers (i.e. deep learning algorithms). The results show also how visual diagnostic reports are easily produced for comparing the algorithm performances using different input big data sets, whereas other reports are produced for comparing performances between different algorithms, using one input data set. Related works are also discussed to show the architecture's differences and advantages.

One of the focal points of the debate is the contrast between the traditional hierarchy structure of C2 organizations and the edge structure. Is the traditional hierarchy structure of C2 necessarily in conflict with the edge structure? Can these two organizational structure models be reconciled to achieve organizational agility transformation? How to reconcile these two models of organizational structure? In order to solve the above problem, we put forward a kind of suitable reconciliation model of agile C2 organization considering our actual situation.

The aim of this paper is to show how industries can use Smart Management System (SMgS) to be competitive in the 21st century. Internet of Things (IoT) will be the key to connecting and communicating among different parts of the smart industries using sensor-like devices, and big data will be continuously collected and analyzed to improve performance. The SMgS will generate new possibilities for better product design, improved qualities, agile supply chain, and enhanced customer satisfaction. It will also help industries to achieve lean and sustainable systems with fewer efforts than traditional approaches. We demonstrate how early adopters have already implemented IoT and are currently generating big data. These efforts have resulted in significant improvements in streamlining their operations. The advantages of IoT and big data applications in different sectors are discussed here with several examples from the industry leaders.

,ieeex,Structured Data for Product Performance Improvement,"SUMMARY & CONCLUSIONSAftermarket reliability data is a cornerstone to understand the performance of one's products against requirements. A successful aftermarket data system goes beyond the basics of supplying reliability figures. Its attributes also include additional metrics for an effective alerting and reporting system to enable proactive response to aftermarket issues. While these system features are key, the implementation and maintenance methodology of the system is crucial to its success. This is because these systems involve big data. In the case presented, it is data which spans several years, for a variety of model numbers on a variety of aircraft platforms or applications. Each set of circumstances yields different reliability figures and associated metrics. With this big data, it is equally crucial to its success to have a methodology to address data integrity, the speed of data, and the portability of data. Our solution with this successful methodology of these features is called Structured Data.A good aftermarket data system is a backbone for any successful organization. A good system in the aerospace industry goes beyond ATA Spec 2000 [1] formatted data and standard reliability figures such as MTBUR (Mean Time Between Unscheduled Removal) and MTBF (Mean Time Between Failure). It is also beyond implementing a Failure Reporting and Corrective Action System (FRACAS). A comprehensive system in the aerospace industry includes several additional measures (i.e. frequency, severity, risk) to represent the Voice of the Customer. And with a built-in mechanism for proactive response to the data, the system can then be considered World-Class.While designing a system with these features is important, its success also hinges upon the methodology of implementation and maintenance. As stated earlier, aftermarket data is considered big data due to the volume of highly specific data. With this big data, it is critical to success to address data integrity, the speed of data, and the portability of data all within a user-friendly experience. For data integrity, do we trust the data? This takes on many forms from cross referencing input and output data to determining an accurate mixed fleet factor. For speed of data, do we have a system in place to handle the cadence of data efficiently? For portability, do we structure our data in such a way where we can be agile to serve potential changes to our system or new systems as our company evolves? For a user-friendly experience, can we structure the data for intuitive analysis for all stakeholders? Thus in the proposed system, all of these aspects of data integrity, the speed of data, the portability of data, and formatting the data per stakeholders are addressed. Our solution with this successful methodology of these features is called Structured Data.The benefits of this newly developed Structured Data extend beyond ATA Spec 2000 in which it is based. The data is structured in a dynamic and interactive environment. This environment includes intuitive analysis and a system of prioritization for corrective action. The key benefit of this Structured Data system is proactive response to aftermarket data analysis.",Product performance;Reliability metrics;MTBUR / MTBF;FRACAS;Voice of Customer;Big data;Data integrity Speed of data;Portability of data;Natural Language Programming (NLP),P.

To counter jamming signals, the operating frequency of the frequency-agile radar transmitting pulse has strong random performance. The chaotic sequence has great random performance, and the sequence generated by the chaotic sequence also has great randomness. Therefore, this paper first generates data through the chaotic sequence and binary quantization method and uses the autocorrelation performance as the criterion, The optimal threshold corresponding to the optimal frequency hopping sequence of the same chaotic sequence is screened out. The selected random Frequency hopping point sequence with better performance has great ambiguity function performance, that is, target detection performance. First, divide the value range of the optimal threshold, use the chaotic sequence and the optimal threshold as the standard data, turn the threshold optimization problem into a pattern recognition classification problem, and use the standard data as the training set to train the neural network.

The level of autonomy is improving by means of Internet-of-Things (IoT), while the level of intelligence is improving through artificial intelligence. The applications of big data analytics and cloud computing techniques in smart grids are also new topics, which have been paid particular attention recently. These paradigms can be used in both grid-scale and local-scale, while the central grid operation center has interoperability with an abundant number of sub-controllers, and aggregators in a wide variety of scales. On the one hand, the system operator must deal with multiple parameters with different kinds of uncertainties.

Story-point estimation enables software development teams to, among other things, better scope products, prioritize requirements, allocate resources and measure progress. Several machine learning techniques have been proposed for automated story-point estimation. However, most of these techniques use open-source projects for evaluation. There are important differences between open-source and commercial projects with respect to story authoring. The goal of this paper is to evaluate a state-of-the-art machine learning technique, known as Deep-SE [3], for estimating story points in a commercial project.

Over this dataset, Deep-SE achieved a mean absolute error of 1.46, significantly better than three different baselines. Model performance nonetheless varied across stories, with the estimation error being larger for stories that had higher points. Our results further indicate that model performance is correlated with certain story characteristics such as the level of detail and the frequency of vague terms in the stories.

Similarly, visual analytics play an essential role in understanding and fitting the analytics prediction in their business decision. Hence, the combination of descriptive, diagnostics and predictive within Visual Analytics emerges as a balanced field to provide understandable predictive insight. Due to the organizational demand and multi-discipline area, the approach to developing visual analytics is still uncertain in the Big Data Project Lifecycle from methodological perspectives.

Provisioning and management of these resources are generally done using statistical algorithms to help decide how to better utilize available compute power; recently, this has been performed mostly by using live migration of virtual machines. Nowadays containers deliver the flexibility to handle many software environments and tasks in a lighter-weight virtualization scheme, providing a more agile alternative to virtual machines for certain applications. Application checkpointing coupled with a container manager allows the live migration of a container. In this work, we present Herd-Monitor, a resource monitoring system to gather performance metrics of containers and their respective compute hosts. This data can be used to analyze the utilization of available resources, characterize workloads, and develop forecast models. With the analysis of the data provided by the monitoring system, we can fine-tune resource provisioning policies, with the end goal of constructing a cloud resource provisioning platform that enables an improvement in usage and execution of container workloads through the use of live migration. The design, development, performance evaluation and characterization of our lightweight resource monitoring tool that enables offline and real-time resource utilization analysis of live migration workloads as well as the performance impact on their hosts are presented.",Cloud computing;Containers;Live Migration;Big Data Infrastructure;Software Systems to Support Big Data Computing;Performance Monitoring;Data Streaming;Cloud Architecture;Realtime Monitoring,A.

The goal of this capability is to expose function-level capabilities, via either a simple application or configuration file, for use in Docker [1], Serverless Architectures [2], or data science/analytic pipelines. The goal is similar to efforts such as Metaparticle [3] and Source-to-Image[4] that aim to lower the barrier to horizontal scaling of data processing and analysis capabilities. In previous years ASPIRE interns have developed tools to ease the acceptance of DevOps principles in JHU APL. They have created a web application, Harmonia, that asked users a few simple questions and supplied the scaffolding for a software project with artifacts to support sound software engineering processes. The lack of user interest has driven us to a more focused objective. NINo will focus on easing deployment to cloud environments. Ideally, any person could develop cloud-based data science services. The team and its work has been organized in an asynchronous and agile manner. There have been three members working on three subsystems: configuration, framework/integration, and artifact generation. An incremental and prototype-driven approach has allowed for creation of increasingly more functional software as internship has proceeded. Interns have been given extensive control over their development processes and have investigated the programming frameworks used. While the initial stages have not resulted in a complete system, the interns have improved their programming skills and complete common coding challenges.

This paper investigates the factors that support, and deter, pair programming adoption in a case study at a software development company in the eThekwini (Durban) region, South Africa. The survey and interviews indicate that the most positive influences are the support from senior and peer staff and the company's willingness to provide the necessary hardware, software and physical layout to enable the use of pair programming. The biggest challenge was the personality mix in a pair, for example introvert/extrovert pairs, where extroverts can dominate pair collaboration.

A varactor diode is integrated into each of these NFRP elements to facilitate simultaneous tuning of its operating frequency and switching its main beam direction. By changing the capacitance values of these two varactor diodes, the antenna realizes two independent, antipodal, unidirectional endfire radiating states with similar realized gain (RG) and front-to-back ratio (FTBR) values within virtually the same frequency-agile ranges. The experimental results demonstrate that the developed antenna exhibits a 5% frequency-agile fractional impedance bandwidth in both of its two oppositely directed endfire states.

For example, research on the performance of buildings may require data from multiple sources that lack a singular standard for data reporting. The Building Management System might report data at regular 5minute intervals, whereas an air-quality sensor might capture values only when there has been significant change from the previous value. Many systems exist to help integrate multiple data sources into a single system or interface. However, such systems do not necessarily make it easy to modify an integration plan, for example, to accommodate data exploration, new and changing data sets or shifts in the questions of interest. We propose an agile data-integration system to enable quick and adaptive analysis across many data sets, concentrating initially on the data alignment step: combining data values from multiple time-series based data sets whose time schedules. To this end, we adopt a Domain Specific Language approach where we construct a domain model for alignment, provide a specification language for describing alignments in the model and implement an interpreter for specification in that language. Our implementation exploits a rank-based join in SQL that produces faster alignment times than the commonly suggested method of aligning data sets in a database.

But is there a recurrent organisational structure pattern in agile software engineering teams? and if so what does that pattern imply, in terms of software architecture quality? We address these questions using mixed-methods research in industry featuring interviews, surveys, and Delphi studies of real agile teams. In our study of 30 agile software teams we found that, out of seven organisational structure patterns that recur across our dataset, a single organisational pattern occurs over 37% of the time. This pattern: (a) reflects young communities (1-12 months old); (b) disappears in established ones (13+ months); and (c) reflects the highest number of architecture smells reported. Finally, we observe a negative correlation between a proposed organisational measure and architecture smells. On the one hand, these insights may serve to aid architects in designing not only their architectures but also their communities to best support their co-evolution. On the other hand, we observe that organisational structures in software engineering influence much more than simply software architectures, and we expect our results to lay the foundations of more structured and rigorous approaches to organisational structure studies and use in software engineering research and practice.",Software organisational structures;human aspects in software engineering;social software engineering;empirical software engineering;industrial mixed-methods research,D.

,ieeex,Exploiting Page Table Locality for Agile TLB Prefetching,"Frequent Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB) misses incur high performance and energy costs due to page walks required for fetching the corresponding address translations. Prefetching page table entries (PTEs) ahead of demand TLB accesses can mitigate the address translation performance bottleneck, but each prefetch requires traversing the page table, triggering additional accesses to the memory hierarchy. Therefore, TLB prefetching is a costly technique that may undermine performance when the prefetches are not accurate.In this paper we exploit the locality in the last level of the page table to reduce the cost and enhance the effectiveness of TLB prefetching by fetching cache-line adjacent PTEs ""for free"". We propose Sampling-Based Free TLB Prefetching (SBFP), a dynamic scheme that predicts the usefulness of these ""free"" PTEs and prefetches only the ones most likely to prevent TLB misses. We demonstrate that combining SBFP with novel and state-of-the-art TLB prefetchers significantly improves miss coverage and reduces most memory accesses due to page walks.Moreover, we propose Agile TLB Prefetcher (ATP), a novel composite TLB prefetcher particularly designed to maximize the benefits of SBFP. ATP efficiently combines three low-cost TLB prefetchers and disables TLB prefetching for those execution phases that do not benefit from it. Unlike state-of-the-art TLB prefetchers that correlate patterns with only one feature (e.g., strides, PC, distances), ATP correlates patterns with multiple features and dynamically enables the most appropriate TLB prefetcher per TLB miss.To alleviate the address translation performance bottleneck, we propose a unified solution that combines ATP and SBFP. Across an extensive set of industrial workloads provided by Qualcomm, ATP coupled with SBFP improves geometric speedup by 16.2%, and eliminates on average 37% of the memory references due to page walks. Considering the SPEC CPU 2006 and SPEC CPU 2017 benchmark suites, ATP with SBFP increases geometric speedup by 11.1%, and eliminates page walk memory references by 26%. Applied to big data workloads (GAP suite, XSBench), ATP with SBFP yields a geometric speedup of 11.8% while reducing page walk memory references by 5%. Over the best state-of-the-art TLB prefetcher for each benchmark suite, ATP with SBFP achieves speedups of 8.7%, 3.4%, and 4.2% for the Qualcomm, SPEC, and GAP+XSBench workloads, respectively.",virtual memory;address translation;translation lookaside buffer;page table locality;prefetching,G.

,ieeex,APCC: Agile and Precise Congestion Control in Datacenters,"Modern datacenter networks exhibit complicated and time-varying traffic patterns, from long-running flows to burst short-lived flows. Recently in-network-telemetry (INT) is employed by datacenter transports to perform precise congestion control (CC). Current INT-based CC works well for long flows, however, suffers from serious performance downgrades when BDP-level small flows burst in the first RTT, due to the reason that current INT information from the receivers (host-based INT) needs at least one RTT to respond. In this paper, we make the first attempt to propose an agile and precise congestion control, called APCC, in datacenter networks, working for traffic patterns that is a mix of BDP-level short flows and long flows. APCC explores INT information from switches (switch-based INT) to feedback the congestion information eagerly, and effectively manage BDP-level flows. APCC utilizes the switch-based INT to schedule the complicated and time-varying traffic stably and precisely, and achieve low latency, high bandwidth and network stability simultaneously. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of APCC. The experiment results show that with data centers load containing many BDP-level flows such as Cache Follower and Web Server, switch-based INT shows huge potential of improving the long tail effect on completion time (FCT). APCC reduces tail delay by 21.7%-28.9% under normal circumstances, and can still reduce tail delay by 9.1% under more severe conditions comparing with HPCC.

For the EOSs with optical sensors particularly, the observation mission is significantly influenced by the uncertainty of cloud coverage, which has been identified as the most dominant factor for the invalidation of remote sensing images. To overcome this uncertainty, uncertainty programming methods, namely, chance constraint programming (CCP), stochastic expectation model, and robust optimization, are put forth. Despite their success, these approaches are limited in that they simplified the complex cloud coverage uncertainty, which may be different from the true cloud conditions, and they did not take the true cloud information into consideration. Motivated by these recent trends toward Big Data of satellite cloud images and machine learning for spatiotemporal prediction, this article explores a dynamic replanning scheme for multiple EOSs based on cloud forecasting. Specifically, we propose a new approach mainly in the following three steps: first, proactive scheduling based on a CCP is implemented and uploaded via ground control; second, cloud forecasting can be continuously conducted relying on the predictive recurrent neural network and the latest satellite cloud image; and third, mission replanning can be conducted according to the initial schedule and relatively accurate cloud information.

However, different layers of a container image may contain substantial duplicate and unnecessary data, which slows down its deployment due to long image downloading time and increased burden on the image registry. To accelerate the deployment and reduce the size of the registry, we propose a new image format, named Gear image, that consists of two parts: a Gear index describing the structure of the image's file system and a set of files that are required when running an application. The Gear index is represented as a single-layer image compatible with the existing deployment framework. Containers can be launched by pulling a Gear index and on demand retrieving files pointed to by the index. Furthermore, the Gear image enables a file-level sharing mechanism, which helps remove duplicate data in the registry and avoid repeated downloading of identical files by a client. We implement a prototype of the container framework, named Gear, supporting the new image format.

,ieeex,Reinforcement Learning-Based and Parametric Production-Maintenance Control Policies for a Deteriorating Manufacturing System,"The model of a stochastic production/inventory system that is subject to deterioration failures is developed and examined in this paper. Customer interarrival times are assumed to be random and backorders are allowed. The system experiences a number of deterioration stages before it ultimately fails and is rendered inoperable. Repair and maintenance activities restore the system to its initial and previous deterioration state, respectively. The duration of both repair and maintenance is assumed to be stochastic. We address the problem of minimizing the expected sum of two conflicting objective functions: the average inventory level and the average number of backorders. The solution to this problem consists of finding the optimal tradeoff between maintaining a high service level and carrying as low inventory as possible. The primary goal of this research is to obtain optimal or near-optimal joint production/maintenance control policies, by means of a novel reinforcement learning-based approach. Furthermore, we examine parametric production and maintenance policies that are often used in practical situations, namely, Kanban, (s, S), threshold-type condition based maintenance and periodic maintenance. The proposed approach is compared with the parametric policies in an extensive series of simulation experiments and it is found to clearly outperform them in all cases. Based on the numerical results obtained by the experiments, the behavior of the parametric policies as well as the structure of the control policies derived by the Reinforcement Learning-based approach is investigated.",Inventory control;preventive maintenance;reinforcement learning;intelligent manufacturing systems,A.

In this paper, flexible 2-dimensional resource allocation is investigated to maximize the energy efficiency (EE) for service transmissions with heterogeneous latency requirements. Exploiting the frequency and time diversities of the resource grid, frequency-selective resource allocation, together with an agile ""on-off"" operation of the power amplifier (PA) are performed by the proposed sliding window-based (SW) algorithm with scalability.

,ieeex,Evaluation of stochastic bounds on the remaining completion time of products in a buffered sequential workflow,"Agile production systems face major issues in satisfying fickle market needs in highly demand-driven industry sectors, such as electronics and mechatronics. In this context, the time needed to complete the production of an item tends to be highly variable, and online estimation of the remaining completion time may suffer the lack of adequate sensor data, especially in existing manufacturing systems. To solve this issue, we propose a new analytical technique for the evaluation of an upper and a lower stochastic bound on the remaining completion time of a product, considering an assembly line made of sequential workstations with transfer blocking and buffer capacity. The approach notably encompasses service times with non-Markovian distribution, and avoids the limitation of existing works requiring the system to be at steady state at the inspection time. The technique is experimented on a case study and validated through simulation, providing an empirical analysis of its complexity.",Assembly lines;inspection;stochastic bounds;remaining completion time;non-Markovian durations,M.

,ieeex,Agile Approach on the Performance Prediction of ARM TrustZone-based Mandatory Access Control Security Enhancement,"Mandatory Access Control (MAC) is one of the most important security mechanisms of Linux, but it may be threatened by vulnerabilities in kernel space. Currently, the ARM TrustZone-based MAC (TZ-MAC) security enhancement method has been proposed to protect the key security function of MAC with the hardware-based trusted execution environment. However, given that each call to the hook set of the TZ-MAC security modules will cause switching between the normal and secure worlds of ARM TrustZone, the specific design of the TZ-MAC framework will substantially affect system performance, and may even be considerably slow to prevent the security module from being applied. Therefore, when researchers design a security module, they need an agile method to predict the performance cost brought by the hook set realized, to assist the optimization of the design scheme and improve system performance. This study presents a performance prediction method of TZ-MAC based on the statistical analysis of the Linux Security Modules (LSM) hook calls. This method is universal for different TZ-MAC frameworks, security modules, and benchmarks. Moreover, the proposed method can predict only the performance based on the security module design of TZ-MAC, and the implementation of the module is not needed. An agile approach of performance prediction for TZ-MAC is conducted based on the performance prediction method. For two different TZ-MAC implementation ideas, we constructed prediction data sets based on the classic benchmarks, namely, LMbench and UnixBench, and verified the effectiveness of our method. The tests based on the security module SELinux show that over 50% of the overhead is caused by 3% of the LSM hook functions, which indicates the direction for future optimization.",Performance Evaluation;TrustZone;Mandatory Access Control,Z.

,ieeex,SymPlot: A Web-Tool to Visualise Symbolic Musical Data,"Some complex musical parameters might be especially difficult to understand for someone with no theoretical expertise in music. Musicians and music scholars alike normally evaluate such parameters visually by departing from scores, which present the musical events at once. Yet for the under-standing of such symbolic representations, musical training is essential, making scores mostly incomprehensible for amateurs. Data visualisation has been applied to meaningfully represent complex musical parameters, thus enabling music amateurs to grasp concepts such as texture or structure. Although scores are one of the ""primary"" sources to understand music, previous work shows a strong bias towards the visualisation of acoustic data, in detriment of the visualisation of symbolic information. To bridge the gap, we present SymPlot, a web-based open source tool to automatically visualise textural density, scoring, and structure from MusicXML files. Due to the multidisciplinary nature of the topic, in this project we have applied the Scrum's agile methodology, an iterative incremental approach specifically tailored for interdisciplinary projects. The tool, aimed at enhancing musical understanding in amateurs and students, as well as in scholars of other disciplines who need to incorporate music into their discourses, i.e., historians, philologists, etc., enables visualisation of local features at various hierarchical levels, highlighting similarities both within and across scores. Our evaluation of SymPlot-based on a five-level rating-scale test performed by 50 participants-suggests that colours increase users' understanding of complex musical parameters.",visualisation;music;data science;digital humanities;score;computational musicology;symbolic music data,P.

,ieeex,Interplay of Machine Learning and Software Engineering for Quality Estimations,"In this era, the agile mindset has innovated the traditional software engineering (SE) process through the integration of DevOps flow engines, scrum iterations, and automation of continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD) cycles. However, the CI/CD integration requires manual code-revisions and refactoring at large scales. Recently, machine-learning (ML) is employed in SE that allows legacy codes to be highly dynamic, less coupling in related modules, automatic code versioning, and refactoring, with less coupling among related modules. However, over time, ML models tend to become bulky, with increasing monotonic losses during model training. To address this, SE techniques like code revisions are employed over ML codes to allow low-order training losses, that enables seamless and precise workflow structures. Motivated from the aforementioned discussions, the paper presents a systematic review of the close interplay of SE and ML and possible interactions in different applications. Suitable research questions and case studies are presented for possible adoption scenarios that depict the close ML-SE interplay share with each other, with the concluding remarks.

There is a need for a decentralized model to carry out the required substantial amount of computation across edge devices as they has led to the innovation of fog computing. Energy consumption among the edge devices is one of the potential threatening issues in fog computing. Their high energy demand also contributes to higher computation cost. In this paper Double Critic (DC) approach is enforced over the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) technique to design the DC-DDPG framework which formulates high quality energy efficiency policies for fog computing. The performance of the proposed framework is outstanding compared to existing works based on the metrics like energy consumption, response time, total cost, and throughput. They are measured under two different fog computing scenarios i.e., fog layer with multiple entities in a region and fog layer with multiple entities in multiple regions.

Coupling this framework with the principle of security as a shared responsibility further enhances the efficacy of an integrated Development, Security, and Operations (DevSecOps) Team within organizations to deliver secured digital solutions. Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSPs) around the world are currently exploring and embracing the digital evolution shifting from monolithic, legacy automation platforms to an application framework of microservices to allow for flexible operations as capabilities and airspace operations evolve. Specific to the US, the ATM automation system of today is comprised of both safety and non-safety critical systems, with mission-essential, efficiency-critical, and mission-support services that are predominately maintained and evolved through multi-year, one contractor-led programs. Although the system has proven resilient, it has not proven to be agile and flexible to allow for advances in capabilities on-board aircraft or in the data integration and sharing with other NAS automation systems. This creates significant overhead in development, sustainability, and operations of the current automation system, and leaves modernization efforts—in terms of new capabilities—in constant investment decision planning cycles, costing agencies not just money, but more time to innovate. To advance aviation into a new generation of interoperability leveraging collaborative frameworks and application specific capabilities, ANSPs must adapt to innovative methods to collect, process, and deliver critical and essential aeronautical, weather, and flight information to air traffic control operators and ultimately to airspace users. Doing so can not only lead to sustaining NAS automation systems while reducing the costs to develop and operate these systems, but it also provides an opportunity to present strategies on how to dramatically reduce the time and integration efforts needed to deploy new capabilities. Leveraging cloud-native technologies and services is a way to realize this automation evolution vision for ANSPs.This paper examines the migration from today’s systems to secure, cloud-native platforms to prove that Mission Services and Mission Applications can be rapidly available / deployable to operators who provide separation and flow management services, using a cyber-secured cloud-native environment. Aeronautical data typically used for tactical decision making is now seen as crucial to the decision-making process in Air Traffic Management (ATM). Integrating global and localized datasets into a digital aviation data platform enhances the capabilities of the solutions and opens the possibilities of leveraging big data analytics and microservices to compute trajectory predictions (TP), demand capacity balancing (DCB), arrival and departure sequencing, airspace delay, among others, in real-time to achieve operator-driven mission objectives. Technology has reached a state of maturity, especially in cloud and hybrid cloud solutions, to support safety of life operations, like ATM. This paper identifies approaches that are being considered for that migration to support the integration of new airspace entrants, the use of application services to provide a dynamic, evolutionary ATM platform, and addresses some of the safety and security strategies that must be considered for this evolution.",Automation;ATM;Cloud-native;Microservices,A.

After a demodulation process with pre-measured information, the original signal under test in both intensity and phase fields can be recovered. The results obtained from the proposed method are consistent with those from traditional linear optical sampling technique. Besides, with a high average mode power, EOFC-based GLOS technique realizes more than 10 dB SNR improvement and has ability to detect weak signal with a power of -47.3 dBm.

,ieeex,Diaspore: Diagnosing Performance Interference in Apache Spark,"Apache Spark is being increasingly used to execute big data applications on cluster computing platforms. To increase system utilization, cluster operators often configure their clusters such that multiple co-located applications can simultaneously share the resources of a cluster node. With resource sharing, applications can compete with each other for shared node resources thereby interfering with each other's performance. Many Spark applications take a long time to execute. Performance interference from other applications can thus cause a Spark application to fail or take even longer time to execute thereby wasting cluster resources and frustrating users. This motivates the need for an automated technique that can detect interference quickly and also diagnose the root cause of the interference to facilitate mitigation of the problem. Most existing approaches are not designed to offer quick interference detection and diagnosis. For example, they typically require extensive training data for every application of interest under various possible input data sizes and resource allocations. In this paper, we systematically investigate the design of a Machine Learning (ML) based technique that addresses this open problem. We implement a tool called Diaspore that integrates our findings. We evaluate the tool with a diverse set of 13 Spark applications executing on a real cluster. Experimental results show that Diaspore requires only small scale training data, i.e., executions under small input sizes and resource allocations. Furthermore, our results show that the tool can offer accurate predictions for applications not present in the training data. Consequently, Diaspore reduces the training time needed to offer predictions. Finally, the feature engineering underlying Diaspore ensures that the tool can detect and diagnose interference quickly in an online manner by sampling only a small fraction of a long running application's execution. This can allow cluster operators to mitigate interference in an agile manner.",Interference detection;big data;machine learning,S. Shah; Y. Amannejad; D.

,ieeex,DeepCP: Deep Learning Driven Cascade Prediction-Based Autonomous Content Placement in Closed Social Network,"Online social networks (OSNs) are emerging as the most popular mainstream platform for content cascade diffusion. In order to provide satisfactory quality of experience (QoE) for users in OSNs, much research dedicates to proactive content placement by using the propagation pattern, user's personal profiles and social relationships in open social network scenarios (e.g., Twitter and Weibo). In this paper, we take a new direction of popularity-aware content placement in a closed social network (e.g., WeChat Moment) where user's privacy is highly enhanced. We propose a novel data-driven holistic deep learning framework, namely DeepCP, for joint diffusion-aware cascade prediction and autonomous content placement without utilizing users' personal and social information. We first devise a time-window LSTM model for content popularity prediction and cascade geo-distribution estimation. Accordingly, we further propose a novel autonomous content placement mechanism CP-GAN which adopts the generative adversarial network (GAN) for agile placement decision making to reduce the content access latency and enhance users' QoE. We conduct extensive experiments using cascade diffusion traces in WeChat Moment (WM). Evaluation results corroborate that the proposed DeepCP framework can predict the content popularity with a high accuracy, generate efficient placement decision in a real-time manner, and achieve significant content access latency reduction over existing schemes.",Social network analysis;cascade prediction;autonomous content placement,Q.

Specifically, botmasters employ DGAs to dynamically produce a large number of random domains and only register a small subset for their actual C&C servers with the purpose to defend them from takeovers and blacklisting attempts. While many approaches and models have been developed to detect DGA-based botnets, they suffer from several limitations, such as difficulties of DNS traffic collection, low feasibility and scalability, and so forth. In this paper, we present BotCensor, a new system that can determine if a host is infected with certain DGA malware with two-stage anomaly detection. In the first stage, we preliminarily attempt to identify malicious domains using a Markov model, and in the second stage, we re-examine the hosts that requested aforementioned malicious domains using novelty detection algorithms.

,ieeex,A Framework for Partitioning Support Vector Machine Models on Edge Architectures,"Current IoT applications generate huge volumes of complex data that requires agile analysis in order to obtain deep insights, often by applying Machine Learning (ML) techniques. Support vector machine (SVM) is one such ML technique that has been used in object detection, image classification, text categorization and Pattern Recognition. However, training even a simple SVM model on big data takes a significant amount of computational time. Due to this, the model is unable to react and adapt in real-time. There is an urgent need to speedup the training process. Since organizations typically use the cloud for this data processing, accelerating the training process has the advantage of bringing down costs. In this paper, we propose a model partitioning approach that partitions the tasks of Stochastic Gradient Descent based Support Vector Machines (SGD-SVM) on various edge devices for concurrent computation, thus reducing the training time significantly. The proposed partitioning mechanism not only brings down the training time but also maintains the approximate accuracy over the centralized cloud approach. With a goal of developing a smart objection detection system, we conduct experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed method using SGD-SVM on an edge based architecture. The results illustrate that the proposed approach significantly reduces the training time by 47%, while decreasing the accuracy by 2%, and offering an optimal number of partitions.",partitioning;edge computing;SGD-SVM,M.

Big data that is associated with IoT could control systems, affect automation and the process industries require R&D support to shape the concept into a functional asset that resolves the problems of users. Hence, investment in research and development (R&D) as an integral part of any IoT project could be the first step towards project success. The objective of this study is to examine the effects of an investment in R&D and size expansion on the firm value of the top Internet of Things companies. This study examines the top 20 Internet of Things companies in the world spanning the period from 2012 to 2019. By using the panel regression random effect model, this study yields two main conclusions. First, the expansion of size by the companies has a significant impact on promoting the firm value. Second, investment in R&D is negatively associated with the firm value of the IoT companies at the initial stage but the lag effect of investment in R&D is associated positively with the firm value. The significant size expansion impact on the firm value in the IoT firms suggests that the agile size could lead to more efficient use of resources and easy identification of growth opportunities. The second conclusion demonstrates the need for a budget allocation for the investment in R&D for the technological progression and scientific advancement in the IoT companies.

,ieeex,Science Autonomy and Planetary Missions: ML and Data Science Applied to the ExoMars Mission,"Future planetary science instruments will be capable of producing far more data than can be transmitted back to Earth, potentially leaving valuable scientific data on a planet's surface. Instruments will need to carefully identify the subset of total data to be prioritized for return, as transmission of the full data volume, even after compression, will not be feasible. The concept of science autonomy, where instruments collect measurement data, perform selected science data analyses onboard, and then autonomously act upon those analyses through self-adjustment and tuning of instrument parameters, can be used to identify and produce an optimal and compact data set for return, maximizing the value of each bit returned to Earth. Furthermore, the selection of the next operation(s) to be run following preliminary measurements, without requiring ground-in-the-loop communication, increases mission efficiency and enables successful yet shorter duration missions to hazardous planetary environments. This capability allows missions to prioritize the most compelling or time-critical data, yielding a more efficient and productive scientific investigation overall. In this paper, we present our implementation using different machine learning (ML) techniques (i.e., clustering, classification) for analyzing science data from the Mars Organic Molecule Analyzer (MOMA) instrument onboard the ExoMars rover Rosalind Franklin. MOMA is a dual-source (laser desorption and gas chromatography) mass spectrometer that will search for past or present life on the Martian surface and subsurface through analysis of soil samples. We use data collected from the MOMA flight-like engineering model to develop mass-spectrometry-focused ML techniques. This effort, in preparation for operating on Mars, is aimed at 1) helping the ExoMars science and operations team quickly analyze new data and support them in their decision-making process regarding subsequent operations and, 2) getting a better understanding of the challenges to enable science autonomy in future missions. We also present two significant challenges we faced in this development that are particular to space missions and will be common to most, if not all, robotic planetary missions. First, the lack of sufficient data volume from these unique and highly optimized instruments to train neural networks, and second the lack of sufficient results from the system to fully trust its output. To tackle the first challenge, we analyze the performance of ML algorithms after adding augmented data. We discuss adopting transfer learning techniques to fine-tune a NN trained on large amounts of commercial instrument data so that it can operate on our limited MOMA dataset. For the ‘trust’ challenge—as it is not always clear what we are looking for in planetary science—we must consider agile ML applications and demonstrate that these will not filter out potentially critical data. We will discuss our concept of a Trust Readiness Level for science autonomy akin to the NASA Technology Readiness Level. This initial project for advanced autonomy illustrates some key first steps of a longer-term objective to enable the spacecraft and instruments themselves to make real-time adjustments during operations as direct human oversight will not be possible for missions going further away in our solar system and beyond.",,V.

,ieeex,The Making of Continuous Colormaps,"Continuous colormaps are integral parts of many visualization techniques, such as heat-maps, surface plots, and flow visualization. Despite that the critiques of rainbow colormaps have been around and well-acknowledged for three decades, rainbow colormaps are still widely used today. One reason behind the resilience of rainbow colormaps is the lack of tools for users to create a continuous colormap that encodes semantics specific to the application concerned. In this paper, we present a web-based software system, CCC-Tool (short for Charting Continuous Colormaps) under the URL https://ccctool.com, for creating, editing, and analyzing such application-specific colormaps. We introduce the notion of “colormap specification (CMS)” that maintains the essential semantics required for defining a color mapping scheme. We provide users with a set of advanced utilities for constructing CMS's with various levels of complexity, examining their quality attributes using different plots, and exporting them to external application software. We present two case studies, demonstrating that the CCC-Tool can help domain scientists as well as visualization experts in designing semantically-rich colormaps.",CCC-Tool;charting continuous colormaps;colormap specification;perceptual uniformity;colormap analysis,P.

The recent surge in dengue outbreaks has caused severe affliction to Malaysian society. Hence, the ability to predict a dengue outbreak and mitigate its damage and loss proactively is very critical. In this paper, we study the possibility of applying machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) approaches to predict the number of confirmed dengue fever (DF) cases in Kuala Lumpur. We identified several contribution factors correlate to a dengue outbreak. In addition to the two frequently used factors (daily mean temperature and daily rainfall), we also took into account the enhanced vegetation index (EVI), humidity and wind speed as input factors to our prediction engines. We collected and cleansed data on these factors and the daily DF incidents in Kuala Lumpur from 2002 to 2012. We then used these data to train and evaluate our 3 ML/DL models. Among the three models, GA_RNN was the best performer and achieved a MAE of 10.95 for DF incidence prediction.",dengue outbreak prediction;machine learning;deep learning,D. N. Pham; T. Aziz; A.

As of today, classical automotive software applications communicate exclusively using vehicle-specific communication protocols such as Controller Area Network (CAN) and FlexRay communication buses. Automotive applications communicate using transport layer messages that are defined and configured for each vehicle system (car model). This hard-wired design makes out-of-the box integrations between heterogeneous automotive products virtually impossible. It also renders automotive integration projects to digital world (smart devices, cloud, big data, IoT gadgets) hard to develop and maintain. We present in this paper Let's DO, a novel platform for interoperability and data exchange between different noncoherent products, systems and devices (both automotive and nonautomotive).

The controller maintains a central view of the network, and its ability to monitor and store network information helps optimize routing. The centralization nature of the controller makes it vulnerable to DoS attacks which can be catastrophic for network functioning. The objective of this paper is to secure the distributed SDN controller architecture against DoS attacks. The proposed architecture is robust, scalable, and uses Big Data techniques to process streams of network traffic in real-time and Machine Learning to detect and mitigate DoS attacks.","Software Defined Networks, DoS Attack, RyuController, Zodiac FX, Kafka, Storm",S.

Enterprises using data as efficiently and smart as possible, can often create a clear competitive advantage and be more responsive to their customer needs. Through the smart use of data, new business models can be created. The most well-known changes of digitization are taking place in the B2C market. The B2B market is affected by this change too. Enterprises recognize the ongoing shift to a service-oriented society and therefore should be able to react directly to the customer needs. Service based business models, such as implementing Smart Services, are developed and intergarted in existing enterprise offerings. This paper reports upon a study of the maturity level regarding Smart Services of three selected German enterprises. The aim is to highlight the the impact of the ongoing digital transformation and map the maturity levels with regards to digitization and Smart Services. The case studies offer a first assessment about the current situation of Smart Services, using sub-categories to pinpoint developments, in manufacturing enterprises. The analysis shows that the maturity levels of these enterprises depend on their technology management, financial resources and corporate culture. The three cases have a high maturity level and already implemented Smart Services in their business model strategy. Nevertheless, there is still potential for improvement, especially regarding `Simultaneous Engineering' and `Automation Level'. It can be stated that within these enterprises financial resources, critical awareness as well as know-how of digitization and Smart Services are available. The cases were organizationally rather set in rigid structures. In order to reach an even higher degree of maturity and thus to remain competitive in the future, the enterprises should fundamentally rethink their corporate culture.

We consider a nine-stage workflow process informed by prior experiences developing AI applications (e.g., search and NLP) and data science tools (e.g. application diagnostics and bug reporting). We found that various Microsoft teams have united this workflow into preexisting, well-evolved, Agile-like software engineering processes, providing insights about several essential engineering challenges that organizations may face in creating large-scale AI solutions for the marketplace. We collected some best practices from Microsoft teams to address these challenges. In addition, we have identified three aspects of the AI domain that make it fundamentally different from prior software application domains: 1) discovering, managing, and versioning the data needed for machine learning applications is much more complex and difficult than other types of software engineering, 2) model customization and model reuse require very different skills than are typically found in software teams, and 3) AI components are more difficult to handle as distinct modules than traditional software components - models may be ""entangled"" in complex ways and experience non-monotonic error behavior.

Many types of technological problems that were once considered prohibitively expensive to tackle are now candidates for exploration. Machine Learning (ML) tools that were valued only in academic environments are quickly being embraced by industrial giants and tiny startups alike. Coupled with modern-day computing power, ML tools can be looked at as hammers that can deal with even the most stubborn nails. ML tools have become so ubiquitous that the current industrial expectation is that they should not only deliver accurate and intelligent solutions but also do so rapidly. In order to keep pace with these requirements, a new enterprise, referred to as MLOps has blossomed in recent years. MLOps combines the process of ML and DS with an agile software engineering technique to develop and deliver solutions in a fast and iterative way. One of the key challenges to this is that ML and DS tools should be efficient and have better usability characteristics than were traditionally offered. In this paper, we present a novel software for Grammatical Evolution (GE) that meets both of these expectations. Our tool, GELAB, is a toolbox for GE in Matlab which has numerous features that distinguish it from existing contemporary GE software. Firstly, it is user-friendly and its development was aimed for use by non-specialists. Secondly, it is capable of hybrid optimization, in which standard numerical optimization techniques can be added to GE.

The efficient operation of the traffic light network plays a fundamental role in the search for solutions to achieve an agile, comfortable, safe and sustainable mobility. For this reason, the Municipal Administration has made important investments in its updating and technological modernization that allows actions for a better performance. Currently the traffic lights of the city are operated by classic programming models, mostly at fixed times in different time zones and others in modes actuated and semi-actuated as scheduled, without responding to changing traffic conditions, making it necessary to search for autonomous traffic regulation systems that adapt their behavior according to the conditions. While adaptive systems based on a wide sensorisation for obtaining information online are an alternative, their current costs of implementation, maintenance and operation, has led to evaluate the new global trends in terms of information capture, storage, processing and use in the optimization of the operation of the traffic signal network. This is how the city of Medellin has been consolidating a Big Data storage system and has developed a technological platform capable of receiving it and executing actions on the traffic light system when it identifies that there are events that generate traffic variations different from normal or daily conditions, which has allowed to improve mobility conditions according to the results obtained, which will be detailed later.

,ieeex,lunule: An Agile and Judicious Metadata Load Balancer for CephFS,"For a decade, the Ceph distributed file system (CephFS) has been widely used to serve the ever-growing big data in many key fields ranging from Internet services to AI computing. To scale out the massive metadata access, CephFS adopts a dynamic subtree partitioning method, splitting the hierarchical namespace and distributing subtrees across multiple metadata servers. However, this method suffers from a severe imbalance problem that may result in poor performance due to its inaccurate imbalance prediction, ignorance of workload characteristics, and unnecessary/invalid migration ac-tivities. To eliminate these inefficiencies, we propose Lunule, a novel CephFS metadata load balancer, which employs an imbalance fac-tor model for accurately determining when to trigger re-balance and tolerate benign imbalanced situations. Lunule further adopts a workload-aware migration planner to appropriately select sub-tree migration candidates. Compared to baselines, Lunule achieves better load balance, increases the metadata throughput by up to 315.8%, and shortens the tail job completion time by up to 64.6% for five real-world workloads and their mixture, respectively. Be-sides, Lunule is capable of handling the metadata cluster expansion and the client workload growth, and scales linearly on a cluster of 16 MDSs.",,Y. Wang; C. Li; X. Shao; Y. Chen; F. Yan; Y.

,ieeex,Knowledge-Based Digital Twin for Predicting Interactions in Human-Robot Collaboration,"Semantic representation of motions in a human-robot collaborative environment is essential for agile design and development of digital twins (DT) towards ensuring efficient collaboration between humans and robots in hybrid work systems, e.g., in assembly operations. Dividing activities into actions helps to further conceptualize motion models for predicting what a human intends to do in a hybrid work system. However, it is not straightforward to identify human intentions in collaborative operations for robots to understand and collaborate. This paper presents a concept for semantic representation of human actions and intention prediction using a flexible task ontology interface in the semantic data hub stored in a domain knowledge base. This semantic data hub enables the construction of a DT with corresponding reasoning and simulation algorithms. Furthermore, a knowledge-based DT concept is used to analyze and verify the presented use-case of Human-Robot Collaboration in assembly operations. The preliminary evaluation showed a promising reduction of time for assembly tasks, which identifies the potential to i) improve efficiency reflected by reducing costs and errors and ultimately ii) assist human workers in improving decision making. Thus the contribution of the current work involves a marriage of machine learning, robotics, and ontology engineering into DT to improve human-robot interaction and productivity in a collaborative production environment.",human-robot interaction;digital twin;human action models;ontology;machine learning,T.

,ieeex,Automated Risk Management Based Software Security Vulnerabilities Management,An automated risk assessment approach is explored in this work. The focus is to optimize the conventional threat modeling approach to explore software system vulnerabilities. Data produced in the software development processes are better leveraged using Machine Learning approaches. A large amount of industry knowledge around security vulnerabilities can be leveraged to enhance current threat modeling approaches. Work done here is in the ecosystem of software development processes that use Agile methodology. Insurance business domain data are explored as a target for this study. The focus is to enhance the traditional threat modeling approach with a better quantitative approach and reduce the biases introduced by the people who are part of software development processes. This effort will help bridge multiple data sources prevalent across the software development ecosystem. Bringing these various data sources together will assist in understanding patterns associated with security aspects of the software systems. This perspective further helps to understand and devise better controls. Approaches explored so far have considered individual areas of software development and their influence on improving security. There is a need to build an integrated approach for a total security solution for the software systems. A wide variety of machine learning approaches and ensemble approaches will be explored. The insurance business domain is considered for the research here. CWE (Common Weaknesses Enumeration) mapping from industry knowledge are leveraged to validate the security needs from the industry perspective. This combination of industry and company data will help get a holistic picture of the software system’s security. Combining the industry and company data helps lay down the path for an integrated security management system in software development.

,ieeex,Neural Fictitious Self-Play for Radar Antijamming Dynamic Game With Imperfect Information,"One emerging issue in modern electronic warfare is the competition between the radar and jammer, which in principle can be viewed as a noncooperative game with two players. In practice, the interaction between the radar and jammer involves multiple rounds as well as partial observation. This makes the competition become a dynamic game with imperfect information. Antijamming strategy design for such kind of a game is still unclear. In this work, the competition between a frequency agile radar and a transmit/receive time-sharing jammer is considered. We utilize an extensive-form game (EFG) with imperfect information to model the multiple rounds interaction between the radar and jammer. For the established EFG, finding Nash equilibrium (NE) strategies is a computationally-intractable task since the number of information states grows exponentially with respect to game stages. Instead, a sampled-based learning method called neural fictitious self play algorithm is used to find approximate NE strategies (ANES). Simulation results show that ANES can be obtained and outperform the common elementary and advanced strategies from the perspective of detection performance.",Antijamming strategies design;approximate Nash equilibrium (NE);dynamic games;electronic warfare;extensive-form game (EFG);imperfect information,K.

,ieeex,Data vault modelling as alternative to dimensional modelling to embrace complexity in data driven decision systems: a critical systems perspective,We live in a complex world where uncertainty is the only certainty. Today's compelling business problem is replaced tomorrow with a problem which was not even imagined yesterday. Data driven decision systems are used by managers in support of their strategic decisions and should be agile and flexibility to survive in our ever change world of complex decisions. The argument presented in this conceptual paper is that data vault modeling is inherently better equipped than dimensional modelling to handle the turbulations of our complex world. The paper investigates the underlying assumptions of dimensional modelling and data vault modelling in terms of requirements collection and the resulting data modelling techniques. It uses critical systems thinking as guiding philosophy to reflect on the benefits of understanding and modelling a variety of perspectives in a problem situation. Critical systems thinking also promotes equal opportunity and accountability. It is argued that both these aspirations can better be achieved by using dimensional modeling as alternative to dimensional modelling. We hope to promote the development of sustainable data driven decision systems which can stand the test of our turbulent times.,data driven decision systems;data vault modelling;dimensional modelling;critical systems thinking,R.

Each new use case requires developing its own machine learning (ML) solution. A ML solution integrates different software components to read, process, and analyze all use case data, as well as to finally generate the output that domain experts need for their decision-making. The process to design a system specification for a ML solution is not straight-forward. It entails two types of complexity: (1) The technical complexity of selecting combinations of ML algorithms and software components that suit a use case; (2) the organizational complexity of integrating different requirements from a multidisciplinary team of, e.g., domain experts, data scientists, and IT specialists. In this paper, we propose several adaptations to Axiomatic Design in order to design ML solution specifications that handle these complexities. We call this Axiomatic Design for Machine Learning (AD4ML). We apply AD4ML to specify a ML solution for a fault detection use case and discuss to what extent our approach conquers the above-mentioned complexities.

Although SDN architecture provides manifold benefits but on the same time its dependence on a logically centralized controller lead to the single point of failure. An attacker can easily capture the any forwarding device and restrict the availability of the controller using different prevalent attacks. Distributed denial of service (DDoS) is one of the most popular attack of this category which is quiet prevalent in SDN. Here, the aim of the attackers is to inject false script in the open flow tables through malicious switches which multiply exponentially. Therefore, in this paper, a blockchain as a service framework has been presented wherein BlockSDSec model is designed to provide security as a separate service for the SDN architecture. This work provides a mechanism to prevent the threats of DDoS at the switch level by embedding an security using blockchain onto the interaction channels of data and control planes. The load balancing at the controller level is achieved using a virtual controller.

In such a situation, plug-and-play Third-Party Libraries (TPLs) introduce a considerable amount of convenience to developers. However, selecting the exact candidate that meets the project requirements from the countless TPLs is challenging for developers. Previous works have considered setting up a personalized recommender system to suggest TPLs for developers. Unfortunately, these approaches rarely consider the complex relationships between applications and TPLs, and are unsatisfactory in accuracy, training speed, and convergence speed. In this paper, we propose a new end-to-end recommendation model called Neighbor Library-Aware Graph Neural Network (NLA-GNN). Unlike previous works, we only initialize one type of node embedding, and construct and update all types of node representations using Graph Neural Networks (GNN). We use a simplified graph convolution operation to alternate the information propagation process to increase the training efficiency and eliminate the heterogeneity of the app-library bipartite graph, thus efficiently modeling the complex high-order relationships between the app and the library.

ParkHop targets special social groups that have stable work routines to serve as crowd workers. We propose a crowdsensing algorithm employing a joint estimator to process crowdsensed data, and evaluate the reliability of crowd workers based on the veracity of their answers to a series of control questions.

Generally, an adaptive signal control system fine-tunes signal timing parameters based on pre-defined control hyperparameters using instantaneous traffic detection information. Once traffic pattern changes, those hyperparameters (e.g., maximum and minimum green times) need to be adjusted according to the evolution of traffic dynamics over a very short-term period. Such adjustment processes are usually conducted by professional and experienced traffic engineers. Here we present a human-in-the-loop parallel learning framework and its utilization in an end-to-end recommendation system that mimics and enhances professional signal control engineers' behaviors. The system has been deployed into a real-world application for an extended period in Hangzhou, China, where signal control hyperparameters are recommended based on large-scale multidimensional traffic datasets.

Web application interface (API) as an emerging technique attracts more and more enterprises and organizations to publish their deep computing functionalities and big data on the Internet, Web API has become the backbone to promote the development of SOC, thus forming the prosperous Web API economy. However, the number of available Web APIs on the Internet is massive and growing constantly, which causes the Web API overload problem. Quality of service (QoS) as an indicator is able to well differentiate the quality of Web APIs and has been widely applied for high quality Web API selection. Since testing QoS for massive Web APIs is resource-consuming, and the QoS performance depends on contextual information such as network and location, hence accurate QoS prediction has become very crucial for personalized Web API recommendation and high quality Web application construction. To address the above issue, this paper presents a context aware deep factorization machine model (CADFM for short) for accurate Web API QoS prediction. Specifically, we first carry out detailed data analysis using real-world QoS dataset and discover a positive relationship between QoS and contextual information, which motivates us to incorporate beneficial contexts for enhancing QoS prediction accuracy. Then, we treat QoS prediction as a regression problem and propose a context aware CADFM framework that integrates the contextual information via embedding technique. Particularly, we adopt MF and MLP for high-order and nonlinear interaction modeling, so as to learn the complex interaction between users and Web APIs accurately. Finally, the experimental results on real-world QoS dataset demonstrate that CADFM outperforms the classic and the state-of-the-art baselines, thereby generating the most accurate QoS predictions and increasing the revenue of Web APIs recommendation.",Service-oriented computing;Web API;quality of service prediction;context aware;deep factorization machine,L.

The foundation for an AI-driven NMS platform is a solid big data storage architecture; a lack of profound data and data hygiene is often one of the biggest obstacles to successfully deploy big data projects.

These trends present new challenges for simulation-based performance assessments that are central to early-stage architectural exploration. Simulators must be lightweight to support rich heterogeneous combinations of general purpose cores and specialized processing units. They must also support agile exploration of hardware-software co-design, i.e. changes in the programming model, compiler, ISA, and specialized hardware. To meet these challenges, we introduce MosaicSim, a lightweight, modular simulator for heterogeneous systems, offering accuracy and agility designed specifically for hardware-software co-design explorations. By integrating the LLVM toolchain, MosaicSim enables efficient modeling of instruction dependencies and flexible additions across the stack. Its modularity also allows the composition and integration of different hardware components. We first demonstrate that MosaicSim captures architectural bottlenecks in applications, and accurately models both scaling trends in a multicore setting and accelerator behavior. We then present two case-studies where MosaicSim enables straightforward design space explorations for emerging systems, i.e. data science application acceleration and heterogeneous parallel architectures.",heterogeneity;hardware-software co design;performance modeling;multi-core architectures;accelerators,O.

,ieeex,IBM Z development transformation,"This article discusses how the product development cycle is being transformed with “Artificial Intelligence” (AI) for the first time in zSeries history. This new era of AI, under the project name IBM Z Development Transformation (zDT), has allowed the team to grow and learn new skills in data science. This transformation forces change structurally in how data is prepared and stored. In z14, there were incremental productivity gains with enhancements to automation with eServer Automation Test Solution and a technology data analysis engine called zDataAssist. However, in z15, AI will significantly accelerate our efficiency. This article explains how Design Thinking and Agile principles were used to identify areas that are of high impact and feasible to implement: 1) what and how data is collected via System Test Event Logging and Analysis engine, Problem ticket management system (Jupitr), and Processor data analysis engine (Xrings); 2) problem identification, analysis, and management (AutoJup) along with Intelligent Recovery Verification Assistant; 3) product design documentation search engine (AskTheMachine); and 4) prototype microprocessor allocation processes Intelligent Commodity Fulfillment System using Machine Learning. This article details the approach of these areas for z15, the implementation of these solutions under the zDT project, as well as the results and future work.",,E. C. McCain; P. Bastien; B. F.

,ieeex,Strategic Information System Planning in the Industry 4.0 Era: A Systematic Literature Review,"Information systems and technology have an important role in building the Company's competitive advantage in facing the Industrial Era 4.0. Strategic Information System Planning (SISP) helps companies formulate reliable information systems that are aligned with business strategies. The academic world should contribute in this regard, but currently, the amount of research related to SISP is very limited. This research is a systematic literature review, which aims to find out more about SISP research trends, research motivations and backgrounds, industries that have been handled, and the methods used in developing SISP. This research is expected to be a trigger for the emergence of new research to support the successful development of SISP in companies in various industries. The results of this research show that several topics are widely researched and need to be improved in the future, namely the alignment of IS strategies with business strategies, the development of specific SISPs in various industries, and the reliability of IS strategies by considering the application of the latest information technology, such as blockchain, artificial intelligence, big data, augmented reality, Internet of Things, and cloud computing. In addition, it is also necessary to develop a SISP framework that is more accommodating to changes in the business environment that is increasingly fast, agile, and collaborative, which includes aspects of business architecture, data/information architecture, technology architecture, information system security, governance, and human resources.",Strategic Information System Planning;SISP;IS Strategic Planning;Systematic literature review,I.

,ieeex,Panel: Addressing the Shortage of Big Data Skills with Inter-Disciplinary Big Data Curriculum,"One major challenge faced by enterprises in contemporary era is the shortage of big data and analytics (BDA) professionals. These professionals possess skills to analyze and derive intelligence from big data generated by enterprises. Currently, universities and colleges have not been able to produce sufficient professionals to meet the ever-growing demand for data analytics skill sets. A possible reason for this may be the narrow focus and lack of interdisciplinary approach to big data analytics education. To address this challenge, this panel brings together practitioners, researchers and educators in big data and analytics; to explore the potentials for developing an interdisciplinary curriculum that will deliver data analytics skills to students across all other academic majors. This might help to produce more agile data analytics professionals and close the gap between demand and supply of those professionals.",Analytics;Big Data;Education;Curriculum,J. C. Nwokeji; R.
