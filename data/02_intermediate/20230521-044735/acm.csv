,acm,Agile Construction of Data Science DSLs (Tool Demo),"Domain Specific Languages (DSLs) have proven useful in the domain of data science, as witnessed by the popularity of SQL. However, implementing and maintaining a DSL incurs a significant effort which limits their utility in context of fast-changing data science frameworks and libraries. We propose an approach and a Python-based library/tool NLDSL which simplifies and streamlines implementation of DSLs modeling pipelines of operations. In particular, syntax description and operation implementation are bundled together as annotated and terse Python functions, which simplifies extending and maintaining a DSL. To support ad hoc DSL elements, NLDSL offers a mechanism to define DSL-level functions as first-class DSL elements. Our tool automatically supports each DSL by code completions and in-editor documentation in a multitude of IDEs implementing the Microsoft's Language Server Protocol. To circumvent the problem of a limited expressiveness of a external DSL, our tool allows embedding DSL statements in the source code comments of a general purpose language and to translate the DSL to such a language during editing. We demonstrate and evaluate our approach and tool by implementing a DSL for data tables which is translated to either Pandas or to PySpark code. A preliminary evaluation shows that this DSL can be defined in a concise and maintainable way, and that it can cover a majority of processing steps of popular Spark/Pandas tutorials.","Apache Spark, DSL development, Data analysis frameworks, Code generation, Assisted editing and IntelliSense, Python Pandas","Andrzejak A,Kiefer K,Costa DE,Wenz O",,2019,Proceedings of the 18th ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Generative Programming: Concepts and Experiences,Association for Computing Machinery,,10.1145/3357765.3359516,20230520-160000,20230521-044735

Developers need a new marketing tool that is based on data. The use of machine learning systems as marketing tools to help solve the problems in house price prediction is an important topic in the real estate industry. The design of machine learning will use CRISP-DM as a framework and to analyze using linear regression and random forest as the best possible accuracy. Besides that, to find a potential market, we will use K-Means as a clustering method. The modeling and experiments to design a machine learning engine that can predict a range of selling prices using linear regression can give maximum accuracy and analyze the target market. The research focusing on different attributes will bring different dominant attributes to the table too.","house development market, linear regression, influence factor, predictive pricing, data science, random forest, machine learning, target market, data analytics, Agile","Wijaya J,Ipung HP,Soetomo MA",,2022,Proceedings of the 2022 International Conference on Engineering and Information Technology for Sustainable Industry,Association for Computing Machinery,,10.1145/3557738.3557856,20230520-160000,20230521-044735

,acm,Unlocking the Potential of NextGen Multi-Model Databases for Semantic Big Data Projects,"A new vision in semantic big data processing is to create enterprise data hubs, with a 360° view on all data that matters to a corporation. As we discuss in this paper, a new generation of multi-model database systems seems a promising architectural choice for building such scalable, non-native triple stores. In this paper, we first characterize this new generation of multi-model databases. Then, discussing an example scenario, we show how they allow for agile and flexible schema management, spanning a large design space for creative and incremental data modelling. We identify the challenge of generating sound triple-views from data stored in several, interlinked models, for SPARQL querying. We regard this as one of several appealing research challenges where the semantic big data and the database architecture community may join forces.","schema evolution, semantic data management, multi-model DBMS","Holubová I,Scherzinger S",,2019,Proceedings of the International Workshop on Semantic Big Data,Association for Computing Machinery,,10.1145/3323878.3325807,20230520-160000,20230521-044735
,acm,A Scalable Methodology to Guide Student Teams Executing Computing Projects,"This article reports on a sequential mixed-methods research study, which compared different approaches on how to guide students through a semester-long data science project. Four different methodologies, ranging from a traditional “just assign some intermediate milestones” to other more Agile methodologies, were first compared via a controlled experiment. The results of this initial experiment showed that the project methodology used made a significant difference in student outcomes. Surprisingly, the Agile Kanban approach was found to be much more effective than the Agile Scrum methodology. Based on these initial results, in the second semester, we focused on use of the Kanban methodology. The findings in the second, more qualitative phase, confirmed the methodology's usefulness and scalability. A key issue when using the scrum methodology was that the students had a very difficult time estimating what could be completed in each of their two-week sprints. The Kanban board, which visually shows and limits work-in-progress, was found to be an effective way for students to communicate with each other as well as with their instructor. In addition, Agile Kanban also streamlined the work required for instructors to efficiently provide guidance to student teams and to understand each team's status. In summary, a scalable Kanban methodology, which can be applied to a wide variety of student computing projects, was found to an effective methodology to guide and manage student projects, improving student outcomes and minimizing instructor workload.","project methodologies, Project-based learning, scalable methodologies","Saltz JS,Heckman RR",,2018,ACM Trans.

,acm,An Approach for the Implementation of Semantic Big Data Analytics in the Social Business Intelligence Process on Distributed Environments (Cloud Computing),"Managing and extracting useful knowledge from social media sources is a challenge. It has attracted a lot of attention from universities and industry. To meet this challenge, semantic analysis of textual data is the subject matter.Today, with the connection present everywhere and at any time, considerable data is born. These data or data become a key player for understanding, analyzing, anticipating and solving major economic, political, social and scientific problems. Data also changes our working procedures, our cultural environment, even restructuring our way of thinking. And just as the scientific, managerial and financial world is interested in Big Data, a new discipline is growing: Fast Data. In addition to the salient volume of data; another variant becomes decisive, the ability to efficiently process data in all their diversity, transforming it into knowledge by providing the right information to the right person at the right time, or even using it to predict the future.The exploitation of Big Data requires the proposition of new adapted mathematical and IT approaches but also a reengineering of managerial approaches for the control of the informational environment of a public or private organization. While basing itself on a strategic information management approach such as Economic Intelligence (EI). The latter combines and encompasses Business Intelligence techniques for internal data management and business intelligence techniques for monitoring and controlling external information flows. However, Big Data, as a boundless source of information for EI, has upset the traditional EI process, which requires a reengineering of the EI approach. My research works perfectly in this context characterized by an uncertain and unpredictable environment.We ask to propose an ontology-based, service-oriented, agile and scalable Social Business Intelligence approach to extract the semantics of textual data and define the domain of massive data. In other words, we semantically analyze social data at two levels, namely the level of the entity and the level of the domain.","Fast Data, Big Data, Social BI, Distributed Processing, Ontology, Cloud","Alcabnani S,Oubezza M,Elkafi J",,2020,Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Big Data and Internet of Things,Association for Computing Machinery,,10.1145/3372938.3373003,20230520-160000,20230521-044735

In this talk, I describe a study in which we learned how Microsoft software teams develop AI/ML-based applications using a nine-stage AI workflow process informed by prior experiences developing early AI applications (e.g. search and NLP) and data science tools (e.g. application telemetry and bug reporting). Adapting this workflow into their pre-existing, well-evolved, Agile-like software engineering processes and job roles has resulted in a number of engineering challenges unique to the AI/ML domain, some universal to all teams, but others related to the amount of prior AI/ML experience and education the teams have. I tell you about some challenges and the solutions that teams have come up with. The lessons that Microsoft has learned can help other organizations embarking on their own path towards AI and ML.","AI, machine learning, industry practice",Begel A,,2019,Proceedings of the Joint 7th International Workshop on Conducting Empirical Studies in Industry and 6th International Workshop on Software Engineering Research and Industrial Practice,IEEE Press,,10.1109/CESSER-IP.2019.00008,20230520-160000,20230521-044735
,acm,Information Resilience: The Nexus of Responsible and Agile Approaches to Information Use,"The appetite for effective use of information assets has been steadily rising in both public and private sector organisations. However, whether the information is used for social good or commercial gain, there is a growing recognition of the complex socio-technical challenges associated with balancing the diverse demands of regulatory compliance and data privacy, social expectations and ethical use, business process agility and value creation, and scarcity of data science talent. In this vision paper, we present a series of case studies that highlight these interconnected challenges, across a range of application areas. We use the insights from the case studies to introduce Information Resilience, as a scaffold within which the competing requirements of responsible and agile approaches to information use can be positioned. The aim of this paper is to develop and present a manifesto for Information Resilience that can serve as a reference for future research and development in relevant areas of responsible data management.","Value creation, Data quality, Information Resilience, Responsible data science, Effective information use","Sadiq S,Aryani A,Demartini G,Hua W,Indulska M,Burton-Jones A,Khosravi H,Benavides-Prado D,Sellis T,Someh I,Vaithianathan R,Wang S,Zhou X",,2022,The VLDB Journal,Springer-Verlag,,10.1007/s00778-021-00720-2,20230520-160000,20230521-044735
,acm,A Cost-Efficient Container Orchestration Strategy in Kubernetes-Based Cloud Computing Infrastructures with Heterogeneous Resources,"Containers, as a lightweight application virtualization technology, have recently gained immense popularity in mainstream cluster management systems like Google Borg and Kubernetes. Prevalently adopted by these systems for task deployments of diverse workloads such as big data, web services, and IoT, they support agile application deployment, environmental consistency, OS distribution portability, application-centric management, and resource isolation. Although most of these systems are mature with advanced features, their optimization strategies are still tailored to the assumption of a static cluster. Elastic compute resources would enable heterogeneous resource management strategies in response to the dynamic business volume for various types of workloads. Hence, we propose a heterogeneous task allocation strategy for cost-efficient container orchestration through resource utilization optimization and elastic instance pricing with three main features. The first one is to support heterogeneous job configurations to optimize the initial placement of containers into existing resources by task packing. The second one is cluster size adjustment to meet the changing workload through autoscaling algorithms. The third one is a rescheduling mechanism to shut down underutilized VM instances for cost saving and reallocate the relevant jobs without losing task progress. We evaluate our approach in terms of cost and performance on the Australian National Cloud Infrastructure (Nectar). Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed strategy could reduce the overall cost by 23% to 32% for different types of cloud workload patterns when compared to the default Kubernetes framework.","cost efficiency, resource heterogeneity, Cluster management, container orchestration","Zhong Z,Buyya R",,2020,ACM Trans.

This goal has forced organizations to evolve their development processes. We report on a study that we conducted on observing software teams at Microsoft as they develop AI-based applications. We consider a nine-stage workflow process informed by prior experiences developing AI applications (e.g., search and NLP) and data science tools (e.g. application diagnostics and bug reporting). We found that various Microsoft teams have united this workflow into preexisting, well-evolved, Agile-like software engineering processes, providing insights about several essential engineering challenges that organizations may face in creating large-scale AI solutions for the marketplace. We collected some best practices from Microsoft teams to address these challenges. In addition, we have identified three aspects of the AI domain that make it fundamentally different from prior software application domains: 1) discovering, managing, and versioning the data needed for machine learning applications is much more complex and difficult than other types of software engineering, 2) model customization and model reuse require very different skills than are typically found in software teams, and 3) AI components are more difficult to handle as distinct modules than traditional software components --- models may be ""entangled"" in complex ways and experience non-monotonic error behavior. We believe that the lessons learned by Microsoft teams will be valuable to other organizations.","data, AI, software engineering, process","Amershi S,Begel A,Bird C,DeLine R,Gall H,Kamar E,Nagappan N,Nushi B,Zimmermann T",,2019,Proceedings of the 41st International Conference on Software Engineering: Software Engineering in Practice,IEEE Press,,10.1109/ICSE-SEIP.2019.00042,20230520-160000,20230521-044735
,acm,Exploiting Page Table Locality for Agile TLB Prefetching,"Frequent Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB) misses incur high performance and energy costs due to page walks required for fetching the corresponding address translations. Prefetching page table entries (PTEs) ahead of demand TLB accesses can mitigate the address translation performance bottleneck, but each prefetch requires traversing the page table, triggering additional accesses to the memory hierarchy. Therefore, TLB prefetching is a costly technique that may undermine performance when the prefetches are not accurate.In this paper we exploit the locality in the last level of the page table to reduce the cost and enhance the effectiveness of TLB prefetching by fetching cache-line adjacent PTEs ""for free"". We propose Sampling-Based Free TLB Prefetching (SBFP), a dynamic scheme that predicts the usefulness of these ""free"" PTEs and prefetches only the ones most likely to prevent TLB misses. We demonstrate that combining SBFP with novel and state-of-the-art TLB prefetchers significantly improves miss coverage and reduces most memory accesses due to page walks.Moreover, we propose Agile TLB Prefetcher (ATP), a novel composite TLB prefetcher particularly designed to maximize the benefits of SBFP. ATP efficiently combines three low-cost TLB prefetchers and disables TLB prefetching for those execution phases that do not benefit from it. Unlike state-of-the-art TLB prefetchers that correlate patterns with only one feature (e.g., strides, PC, distances), ATP correlates patterns with multiple features and dynamically enables the most appropriate TLB prefetcher per TLB miss.To alleviate the address translation performance bottleneck, we propose a unified solution that combines ATP and SBFP. Across an extensive set of industrial workloads provided by Qualcomm, ATP coupled with SBFP improves geometric speedup by 16.2%, and eliminates on average 37% of the memory references due to page walks. Considering the SPEC CPU 2006 and SPEC CPU 2017 benchmark suites, ATP with SBFP increases geometric speedup by 11.1%, and eliminates page walk memory references by 26%. Applied to big data workloads (GAP suite, XSBench), ATP with SBFP yields a geometric speedup of 11.8% while reducing page walk memory references by 5%. Over the best state-of-the-art TLB prefetcher for each benchmark suite, ATP with SBFP achieves speedups of 8.7%, 3.4%, and 4.2% for the Qualcomm, SPEC, and GAP+XSBench workloads, respectively.",,"Vavouliotis G,Alvarez L,Karakostas V,Nikas K,Koziris N,Jiménez DA,Casas M",,2021,Proceedings of the 48th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture,IEEE Press,,10.1109/ISCA52012.2021.00016,20230520-160000,20230521-044735
